User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: I don't care . {vocalsound}
User Interface: Oh this , you mean ?
Project Manager: Yes . The prototype .
Industrial Designer: Huh ?
User Interface: Yes , well uh this is it . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound} This is it .
Project Manager: Well , thank you . Uh , now {disfmarker}
User Interface: It's uh it's uh it's yellow . And uh , this is rubber . And and and this too . The
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
User Interface: the sides .
Project Manager: Yes .
User Interface: And the rest is hard plastic . And uh {disfmarker} We uh we had some uh {vocalsound} {disfmarker} We had a new idea {vocalsound} that that this can uh can be uh uh turned inside .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: And then it covers the {disfmarker} these buttons
Project Manager: Okay .
User Interface: until here or something .
Marketing: Yes .
User Interface: And then you can still use the the power button and the mute and the the joystick .
Project Manager: Mm-hmm .
User Interface: So , you can still operate uh all the things . Because you don't always use the menu . And then it can break .
Project Manager: Okay . And the buttons ?
User Interface: Uh , well uh {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Big . {vocalsound}
User Interface: Big buttons . And everything is blue , except the power button . And the mute . Of uh {disfmarker} yeah , and the mute and the the other button . {vocalsound} Yeah . Channel higher channel button .
Industrial Designer: {gap} .
Marketing: Yeah .
Project Manager: And the joystick is for the volume and the channels .
User Interface: Uh , yes . Yes ,
Industrial Designer: Yes .
User Interface: that's uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: Very obvious .
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Up is channel up . Down is channel down . To the right is volume up . To the left is volume down .
User Interface: Yeah .
Project Manager: Okay , so if joystick and L_C_D_ . What's the R_R_ {gap} d {vocalsound}
User Interface: R_R_'s the l the the the the company uh logo .
Industrial Designer: The R_R_ ?
Project Manager: Okay . Very good .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: So , we have {disfmarker}
Marketing: That's on the rub rubber part .
User Interface: Uh , yes . Yes . That's about here .
Project Manager: So , what they say on the side is put fashion there . Yes . It's good .
User Interface: Oh .
Project Manager: So , that's it . That's prototype .
Marketing: Yeah ?
Project Manager: Now , the finance . {vocalsound} We don't know if it's {disfmarker} th it {disfmarker} if it's okay .
Marketing: Alright . {vocalsound}
Project Manager: So , I'm gonna look .
Marketing: Do we {disfmarker}
Project Manager: We have {disfmarker}
Marketing: Do we change the {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Sorry ?
Marketing: Do we change the the order ? Or are we going to uh ev evaluate it first ?
Project Manager: Finance is um {disfmarker} Yeah it's {disfmarker} No , first uh {disfmarker} Yes . We have to evaluate the product yet .
Marketing: Okay .
Project Manager: Sorry .
Marketing: That's uh um {disfmarker} {gap} That can be none . Um , we gonna do the evaluation now , together . But I have uh a introduction how it works . So , it will come up . Uh-oh . Okay . Um , yeah . Well , we uh {disfmarker} uh , I have um thinked a few evaluation uh criterias , uh based on um our marketing strategy , on uh the latest trends , on user preferences . Uh , we have a seven point scale from uh true , as well . To false , seven ? And on base of each c uh criteria , we need to um give a rating . We can uh {disfmarker} Well , it look like this . But we gonna uh do it here , they said . {vocalsound} So , you hope found out how to do it with a Word document . Yeah . Okay , yeah . Yeah . Um , well uh we have the Word document
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Criteria .
Marketing: You {disfmarker} {gap} So we open up that blank here . Um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Think I can {disfmarker} Uh , what this just an example . So , this not very important . But um , if I can get a number in here . Hmm .
Project Manager: No , it's okay .
Marketing: Well , uh we can't do that .
Industrial Designer: I'll get it .
Project Manager: Oh , it's okay .
Marketing: Um , so uh you have to think of it as uh the remote control is techno technologically innovative . Uh , and then we have to uh agree on the rating together . And in the end , we will c uh count an average of all rating . The first uh on each item .
Project Manager: What do you think ?
Marketing: Yeah , I think it's uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Uh , well technologically using , it's not uh {disfmarker} it doesn't contain many new features . Only the L_C_D_ . So , it {disfmarker} Um , I think I will give it a {disfmarker} yeah , yeah , yeah {gap} , a four . Hmm .
Industrial Designer: I think the scroll-button is something also uh new . What uh {disfmarker} not anoth uh ,
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: not a lot of uh {disfmarker} a lot of uh remote controls have . I think technologically I'll give it an seven . Si six six .
Project Manager: {gap} Yeah .
Industrial Designer: Sorry , six .
Marketing: So now i I think you uh see it {gap} um its statement .
Industrial Designer: Oh , true or false .
Marketing: And you {gap} true or false .
Industrial Designer: Oh , uh I'll I'll give it uh a t a two .
Marketing: And true is one . So , yeah . Yeah .
Project Manager: Two .
Industrial Designer: Sorry .
Project Manager: You ?
User Interface: Three .
Project Manager: Me too . So it's a three .
Marketing: 'Kay . Um , well {disfmarker} It's a one . {vocalsound} The first item . So , okay the second item . Um , this product is for all sorts of customers .
User Interface: Mm {disfmarker}
Marketing: Well , it's a statement which uh I disagree with , because we uh really aim uh at at young market and I think the way it looked uh c uh totally in yellow , it's not uh really aimed for all customers . It doesn't look like that .
Project Manager: So it's a {disfmarker}
Marketing: That's uh a six .
Industrial Designer: Five .
User Interface: Mm , four .
Project Manager: Yes , it's for the younger g group . So it's uh half half of the people .
User Interface: Yeah , but it's it's {disfmarker}
Project Manager: So I think it's four .
User Interface: Yeah . I mean it still has l large buttons and not m many buttons .
Project Manager: No .
User Interface: So {disfmarker} I mean , the colours are for young people ,
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm .
User Interface: but
Project Manager: Yes . So , I think it's four .
User Interface: older {disfmarker}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
User Interface: Yeah .
Industrial Designer: Maybe version uh three point O_ uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} has other colours . {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah . Maybe .
Project Manager: Okay . Give it a four .
Industrial Designer: Four .
Project Manager: Yep .
Marketing: Four . Uh , okay . Mm .
Project Manager: We put the fashion in electronics .
Marketing: That's uh the motto of our company . Yeah , well do we do this with uh this product ? I um {disfmarker} Yeah . I think if we do this , as it's uh uh c uh it's really orientates on the design . Um , so I would give it a two .
Industrial Designer: Me too a two , because only the battery is not uh techin uh technologically high standard . But the rest of it is . So , I think a two .
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
User Interface: Yes . Two .
Project Manager: Uh , I say uh a five .
Marketing: Two .
Project Manager: It's not fashion , it's new . It must be a fashion . But it isn't .
Industrial Designer: It {disfmarker} it will be fashion .
Project Manager: Yes . It w If it's not a fashion we can put it in it . So , it must be a fashion . I think it's a five .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Okay .
User Interface: Then make it th three .
Marketing: Okay . Yes , I'll think of that too .
Project Manager: No . Oh .
Industrial Designer: 'Kay . Three is okay .
Marketing: Yeah , agree ?
Project Manager: I use my feet though . {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Oh , we'll wait outside .
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound} A three .
Project Manager: Okay .
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Yeah okay .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Marketing: The next element um is the product looks good . Well personally , I do not prefer a um remote control that's fully in yellow . So , I would give this a five .
Industrial Designer: I give it a one . {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
User Interface: {gap} . Yes , a one . I like it .
Project Manager: Well , I say three . So , counting then is two and a half . {vocalsound}
Marketing: We have to do our uh {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Say two .
Marketing: Two or three ?
Project Manager: Okay , two .
Industrial Designer: Two .
Marketing: Two . Okay .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Marketing: So , well we gonna do the next part . Uh , yep . Uh uh , the next statement . It has not too much buttons . Um , yeah , I I have uh said is not because uh a low number is better . And in the end we calculate an average . So , um that's why it's a negative in it . Um , well this one of our aims not have too much buttons . So , um uh did we uh do that ? Well , uh if we go to {vocalsound} uh this fashion , I {disfmarker} We still have caused uh a lot of uh buttons for the numbers . But you can you can go for that . And um that way , you don't have a lot of buttons over . So , I would give this a two .
Industrial Designer: One .
Project Manager: {vocalsound} You ?
User Interface: One . {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Me too . One .
Marketing: One . {vocalsound} Um , but {vocalsound} where where is the {gap} ?
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Next , six . It does not get lost easily .
Marketing: So {disfmarker} Yeah , did we implement uh the sound ?
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
User Interface: Yes . {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Just a small thing . {vocalsound}
Project Manager: No , we did not . So , but can it get lost if it's such a thing ?
User Interface: Yeah , but uh {disfmarker} Yeah .
Industrial Designer: Ah . Yellow .
Project Manager: I don't think so .
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Looks like a pistol .
Project Manager: Yes . Not a not a normal shapes . So {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Uh {disfmarker} It won't get between uh the pillows uh on the couch .
Project Manager: No . It won't get lost .
Marketing: Yeah .
Project Manager: So {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Uh {disfmarker}
Marketing: It won't .
Project Manager: A one ? {vocalsound}
User Interface: Yeah .
Industrial Designer: Yeah , o one .
Project Manager: Okay , a one .
Marketing: One .
Project Manager: Next .
Marketing: Okay , um well we aimed for the younger market .
Project Manager: {gap}
Marketing: Uh yeah , did we achieve that . I think with the way it looks and um it is designed , I will give it a two .
Project Manager: Yeah me {disfmarker} {gap}
Industrial Designer: Yeah . Me too .
Project Manager: That was our target . Two .
Industrial Designer: Two .
Project Manager: Yep .
Industrial Designer: Yeah ? Yeah .
Marketing: Yeah .
Project Manager: Right . There's a fancy look-and-feel .
Marketing: Uh , yes . That that was uh , yeah , one of the most important things that uh Trendwatch said . I didn't uh say it in my presentation . But um , well does it have that ? I would say yes . So um {disfmarker} Well , let's also give this a two . T
Industrial Designer: I gave this a one because of the rubber . It feels soft . Uh , it looks like a l uh uh b uh , a bit like a joystick . It's {disfmarker} Yeah . Yeah , f very fancy {gap} trendy .
Project Manager: Okay .
User Interface: Yes , a one .
Project Manager: I say a two . It's a a bit personal . If it's fancy .
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah .
Project Manager: So I think s two is better .
User Interface: Yeah , okay .
Industrial Designer: Two is okay .
Marketing: Okay . Two .
Industrial Designer: {gap} .
Marketing: And um , then the last one I could think of , uh it goes with the latest trends .
Project Manager: No , it's new . Innovation .
Marketing: If we looked at the latest trends for the uh younger people , and they ate uh fruit and vegetables , well it has a um a nice colour , uh well compared to food but we didn't uh {disfmarker} We did not paint any uh fruit and vegetable on it for something like that .
Industrial Designer: Oh .
Marketing: So , I would {disfmarker} did not give this uh a one or two . I {disfmarker} We'll go for a three .
Project Manager: {gap} .
Industrial Designer: I go for two because uh the the shapes are still round . Uh , the latest trends are soft things , you know , like uh I said in my presentation . Uh {disfmarker}
Marketing: Yes .
Industrial Designer: But the the colours are um basic , like yellow , red , um blue . Something what also younger people want . It's also a trend , so I'll give it a two .
Project Manager: Okay .
User Interface: Mm , three .
Project Manager: Me too . Three .
Marketing: A three .
Project Manager: Yeah .
Marketing: Okay . So um , come back to the presentation now . So , we find yourself there , and now we have to calculate an average rating .
Project Manager: Effort is three , ten and twelve . Thirty , forty , fifty , {gap} .
Marketing: So , we will do that . Yes .
Project Manager: Twenty one . So , it's uh two and three nine two and one third .
Marketing: By nine .
Industrial Designer: Two .
Marketing: Yeah . Um , uh okay . {vocalsound} Two .
Project Manager: Yep .
Marketing: Come on . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Uh , nah . Okay .
Marketing: So uh , that's a pretty low rating , I think .
User Interface: {vocalsound} Yes .
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: So , it's good .
Marketing: So , according to our uh own evaluation uh we did a good job . {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Okay .
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Thank you .
Industrial Designer: Yeah , I think {gap} .
Marketing: Oh . Nah . How am I doing ? Yes .
Project Manager: Okay .
Marketing: And I closed your slide-show .
Project Manager: Back to my uh {disfmarker}
Marketing: Which one was the last for you ? Uh , dreaming .
Project Manager: Yep . Next please .
Marketing: Next . Finance .
Project Manager: So , now uh we have a product . Very happy . But uh , is it cheap enough ? Um , so if uh {disfmarker} I'll have a look . We have a battery . One battery .
User Interface: Mm-hmm .
Industrial Designer: Cheapest there is .
Project Manager: Okay , one battery . Electronics . Advanced chip .
Industrial Designer: Expensive .
Project Manager: Yeah it's the most advanced . Chip-on-print . We have that one .
Industrial Designer: Well , it's the most advanced .
Project Manager: We have the simple , regular and advanced .
Industrial Designer: Advanced .
Project Manager: We have the adva advanced . 'Kay , so uncurved or flat . Nope . Single curved or double curved ? We have double curved . {gap} {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: So {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Then we have plastic , wood , rubber .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {gap} we have half rubber , half plastic .
User Interface: Mm , yes .
Project Manager: No titanium . Special colour . Yes , yellow .
Industrial Designer: Uh , yellow . {vocalsound}
Marketing: Yeah .
User Interface: Mm , yeah .
Project Manager: Interface , push-button . Scroll-wheel , integrated scroll-wheel push push-button , or L_C_D_ display .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: So , we have the L_C_D_ We have two scroll-wheels ? Or one ?
Industrial Designer: One .
Marketing: One .
Project Manager: And it's not really a s
Industrial Designer: Joystick uh thing .
Marketing: {gap} .
Project Manager: Yeah , it's this one . Now , uh button supplement .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Special colour . We already {disfmarker} Uh , that's the {disfmarker} from the {disfmarker} for the buttons . The buttons are regular colour .
User Interface: Mm , yeah .
Project Manager: So , then uh {disfmarker} then then then then then then {disfmarker} Then {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} We're not gonna make it . {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Uh , no . It's too expensive .
Industrial Designer: Yeah . {vocalsound} Wh
Project Manager: So , we have to change something .
Industrial Designer: What what are the costs ?
Project Manager: Fifteen Euros .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Fifteen .
Project Manager: Yeah , well uh when we lose one scroll-wheel , it's okay . 'Cause we can't lose the battery . We can't lose the advanced chip . We can't lose the double curve . We have rubber , special colour .
Marketing: {gap} . We would have uh n
Industrial Designer: A special colour .
Project Manager: Oh , no , we {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Uh , I don't think it's a very special colour .
Project Manager: No , it's uh {disfmarker} Sorry ?
Industrial Designer: Yellow ? Uh , is it a special colour ?
Marketing: For a remote control .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} What ?
Marketing: I've {disfmarker} For a remote control , I think it is . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Yeah . {vocalsound}
Marketing: If we would have uh uh normal buttons instead of uh the joystick . For up down left right .
Project Manager: Um , then we uh lose two Euros . Then we have thirteen Euros . Half a Euro too much . Exactly the special colours . So {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: And what if we use only one sort of um {disfmarker} Um {vocalsound} just only plastic or only rubber ?
Project Manager: That's one Euro .
Industrial Designer: One Euro discount . {vocalsound}
Project Manager: So , I don't think that's good . Mm {disfmarker} I think we have to keep the L_C_D_ . If {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: If we change the joyst uh the joystick thing into a button up , button down , button right , button left .
Project Manager: Yes . Then it's only thirteen Euros .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} And then we'll lose fifty cent in what ?
Project Manager: So uh {disfmarker} yeah . Yeah . Then you have {disfmarker} Or you have to cut this off .
Industrial Designer: Uh {disfmarker} uh-uh .
Project Manager: Then it's not good anymore .
Industrial Designer: No .
Project Manager: So , wait . Okay . I'll have a look . {vocalsound} We {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: And if you say it's just a r uh normal colour {disfmarker} it's a normal colour , wh {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Yellow rubber .
Industrial Designer: No one will see it . {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Yeah , normal .
Industrial Designer: Normal colour , and the the joystick away , and put the button up , button down , right , left .
Project Manager: Uh {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: And it's twelve Euros , I think .
Project Manager: One minute , please . Uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Is it maximum . Um {disfmarker} Yeah , it's normal colour . But if you lose the joystick , it's still uh an advanced chip ?
Industrial Designer: No . Uh , no , no , no .
Project Manager: Or it's then a regular ?
Industrial Designer: Uh {disfmarker} Oh , wait wait wait .
Marketing: The advanced chip was for the L_C_D_ wasn't it ?
User Interface: Yeah .
Industrial Designer: Oh yeah .
Project Manager: So , the advanced is for the L_C_D_ and the regular for the joystick .
Industrial Designer: Oh yeah . Yeah . Yeah , yeah .
Project Manager: And what if we lose the L_C_D_ ?
Industrial Designer: If we lose the L_C_D_ , then we have an uh regular chip and no L_C_D_ .
Project Manager: Yeah , regular chip . But {disfmarker} Is it a good design ?
Industrial Designer: Uh , yeah . Then you'll have to m uh see the menu on the television . And you don't have the L_C_D_ .
Marketing: If uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: So , the T_V_s has to uh {disfmarker} have to be up-to-date .
Marketing: If we have the n no buttons {disfmarker} If we have we have uh not a joystick but buttons , we would have {disfmarker} uh , we have thirteen Euros ?
Project Manager: Mm , yes .
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
Marketing: And then uh we move the the colour . What will that be ?
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
Project Manager: Then it's okay .
Industrial Designer: Huh . No knew that .
Marketing: Yeah . {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Okay , so no joystick . Oh no , but we {disfmarker} then we get push-buttons from half a Euro .
Industrial Designer: Yeah , then it's twelve Euro fifty , then it's okay .
Project Manager: Uh , yes , yes , yes , yes . No joystick . Push-buttons . No special colour . Twelve and a half Euros . Then it's okay . So , we have to change that a little bit . And you cannot use the red and green button . Because if you give them a s uh colour ,
User Interface: Okay . All the same uh {disfmarker}
Project Manager: you have to pay point two Euros .
Industrial Designer: So , all the buttons has to {disfmarker} have to be the same colour .
Project Manager: Yes .
Industrial Designer: But then the print on it will g um change it . Make it uh for everybody to see what button it is . Uh l How you call it ?
User Interface: Mm , yeah . Recognisable . Like what {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Recognisable , yeah .
Project Manager: Yes .
User Interface: Yeah . Mm , yeah .
Project Manager: So {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Yeah ?
User Interface: Okay .
Industrial Designer: Okay .
Project Manager: {gap} So {disfmarker} Well {disfmarker} Now we have to change that , but that's okay . Rubber . What's the normal colour ?
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Oh , well that's clear .
Project Manager: {vocalsound} So {disfmarker} And {disfmarker}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Where's {gap} ? Yeah . So , now it's {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: And the joystick away . And its buttons .
Project Manager: Yeah . It is . But then it will be just that ones .
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
Project Manager: Now it's {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {gap} still , he waited at the {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Very good .
Marketing: No .
Project Manager: Now , uh project eva evaluation . Well {disfmarker} What do you think of it ? Uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: About the
Project Manager: About the project .
Marketing: Project .
Industrial Designer: process . Went good . Uh {disfmarker} I think uh the creativity uh {vocalsound} was good enough .
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} We have a gun instead of a remote control . Um {disfmarker} Uh leadership . Yeah , you were the project project manager , and uh had the final vote .
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} yeah that was clear . Team-work okay . Everybody uh has something uh to say about it . And uh {disfmarker} no , uh o only the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} the drawing uh was very difficult . But , nah . New ideas found . {vocalsound} Nope .
Project Manager: Okay . And you .
User Interface: Yeah , well the same . I I espe I especially uh liked the the means , the the SMARTboard and uh {disfmarker} Yeah , it uh {disfmarker} It brings up new ideas when you work with uh with it .
Project Manager: Okay .
User Interface: Yeah .
Marketing: Yeah , I think you have to compare it to if you would have a normal um normal project without laptops uh and without these devices . I think um {disfmarker} Well , the laptops if you have them out front of you , you sometimes looking at that instead of the presentation . Um , well uh the draw-board , well you can draw things . But it not really going very convenient .
User Interface: Mm-hmm .
Marketing: Uh , maybe it will be easier if you have a smaller monitor {gap} and uh you would also see there . And with a normal mouse . Um , and uh the project . Yeah , I agree on what was said uh mainly . Uh , yeah but you always have that some people are talking more than others . And maybe is then um the task of the the project manager to also uh ask more to the people uh less talking . To tell their opinion .
Project Manager: Okay . Well , what do I have to say . I think it was good . Not too many discussions .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} No .
Project Manager: So , it's good for the speed .
User Interface: No .
Industrial Designer: Yep .
Project Manager: So , I think we're ready .
Marketing: Yeah .
Project Manager: Good price . Evaluation ready . Ready .
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Beer .
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} That's it .
Industrial Designer: Yeah ? Okay then .
