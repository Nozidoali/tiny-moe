Project Manager: Uh fourth meeting . {vocalsound}
User Interface: We have to do what ?
Project Manager: Some extra deciding .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} W what ? Alri alright . We'll see .
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Well {disfmarker}
User Interface: Oh .
Project Manager: {gap} I'll show you the notes again . Very interesting .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Well you'll you two will uh present us your prototype .
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
Project Manager: Then um {disfmarker} I guess that's your bit ? I I didn't s see anything about it ,
Marketing: Yeah .
Project Manager: so {vocalsound} I already uh thought you uh you were {gap} to do that .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: So the you're uh {gap} .
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: I'll show you how we're going to do with financing this uh design .
User Interface: Mm .
Industrial Designer: Yeah , that's important too . Yeah . {vocalsound}
Project Manager: And then we'll evaluate , after after we have redesigned it .
User Interface: {vocalsound} Bit late . {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Because uh well we'll see about the costs . Um we'll uh evaluate our p our uh production and then uh we can close .
Industrial Designer: Alright .
Project Manager: Well the finance uh we'll do later , so um firstly uh {vocalsound} I'll show you the notes . {vocalsound} I don't think it's very interesting . {vocalsound}
User Interface: I think it is .
Project Manager: Oh nei . Uh no . {vocalsound} Alright . This is copy paste . So {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: From me of course , yeah .
Project Manager: Of course . You had some very strange layout .
Industrial Designer: Well from us all , yeah , from all of us . Yeah . {vocalsound} It's a nice chorus , yeah .
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Well um {disfmarker}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: We ge we went through the agenda ,
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: and well we had some uh some presentations from you three . And uh I summarised what you said to us . So uh I don't think it's very interesting and go through it again .
Industrial Designer: Repeat it yeah . Alright .
Project Manager: So uh {disfmarker} This is what we decided . It's also copy paste from what we made together . So we still know that .
Marketing: Okay .
Project Manager: And then uh we can we can uh use the time better . Well uh next you two will uh present uh the pot prototype for us .
Industrial Designer: Alright , we both uh will ?
Project Manager: Yeah .
Industrial Designer: Or one of us will ?
User Interface: {vocalsound} Alright .
Industrial Designer: Uh {disfmarker}
User Interface: No you go and I'll uh supplement you .
Industrial Designer: Alright . If I make mistakes uh you'll uh {disfmarker}
User Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah .
Project Manager: Correct . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Right . Uh well this is our design .
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Uh it's pretty uh much uh like uh Mike draw uh drew uh the in the during the last meeting . With uh the different uh perspectives of it . Uh we'll begin uh with the front . We have of course uh the the round shape uh the round uh basic shape . Um with uh the upper part being the front . Th So there's this part um {vocalsound} which is made of hard plastic , the front . And uh we're we're using different colours . Of course for the launch we use the basic ugly colours ,
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah .
Industrial Designer: and later we'll put out uh more interesting covers with different patterns and pictures and everything .
Project Manager: Mm-hmm .
Industrial Designer: But basically , different colours , bright colours not black , too dark . Fancy colours . {vocalsound} Um then we have uh the lower part {vocalsound} of the of the device . Uh which is of course um part of the back actually , because it's also titanium . You can see it also on the on the on the side view , that only this part is the front , and the rest of it , the under uh the under side uh of it , yeah , the back side and the lower part of the front is of course titanium made of titanium , and has the titanium colour of course , the look . Um then we have uh on back on the front uh the logo in the upper corner ,
Project Manager: Mm .
Industrial Designer: uh which is uh made uh which is also part of the back , part of the titanium uh titanium part .
User Interface: Yeah , it's a double R_ , but {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Yeah ?
User Interface: It's a double R_ .
Industrial Designer: It's a double R_ . Yeah the logo {disfmarker}
User Interface: But {vocalsound} it's very difficult to to draw that in {disfmarker} Yeah .
Project Manager: Yeah , alright .
Industrial Designer: Uh uh it's difficult to draw so small , but it's our double R_ uh logo is in there .
Project Manager: Okay . Yeah .
Industrial Designer: Um so that's the logo in the upper lef uh right corner . Then we have the buttons . Uh it's difficult to draw again the little oval or round {disfmarker} I think oval will be better for the for the d for the different uh channel buttons .
User Interface: Oval yeah .
Project Manager: Alright .
Industrial Designer: So {gap} uh oval , n those are here . And then we have the m The m
User Interface: Channel up and volume ?
Industrial Designer: Yeah the the con the the the , yeah , the t volume and the channel controls uh in the middle here . Um um with kind of arrow shapes , which makes it also a bit more exciting than basic round or um uh {vocalsound} uh square buttons . And also here are the two uh buttons we agreed on . We have the Okay button . Oh nei we uh the Okay button's here in the middle of the of the operators , of the channel and uh volume um changers .
Project Manager: Mm-hmm .
User Interface: Yeah .
Industrial Designer: And then we've here the Menu button and the {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Alright .
User Interface: Menu for the L_C_D_ screen .
Industrial Designer: And the video button . The {disfmarker}
Project Manager: So {disfmarker}
Marketing: Mm right .
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Yeah . And of course this low part , this is the L_C_D_ screen .
Project Manager: 'Kay .
Industrial Designer: Uh this is what we made of it . You can make uh suggestions uh if you want .
Project Manager: Well if I look at it , the side the side view {disfmarker}
User Interface: Well , at the back {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Maybe we maybe we should finish first uh our talk
User Interface: Yeah .
Industrial Designer: and then you can add suggestions .
Project Manager: Oh yeah alright . Yeah {gap} .
Industrial Designer: Maybe I I don't want to {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I don't want to suppress you but n I'll uh finish this uh quick .
Project Manager: {gap}
Industrial Designer: Um okay I've had everything I guess on the front ?
User Interface: No the back . With the logo and our uh l uh {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Yeah the back . Yeah . {vocalsound} We thought about {disfmarker} Yeah , uh the back is of course totally titanium . {vocalsound} And we thought about the logo big in the middle .
Project Manager: Mm-hmm .
Industrial Designer: Just so again the double R_ . We have then the logo on front and on the back .
Marketing: Mm-hmm .
Industrial Designer: Maybe that's too much
Project Manager: Okay .
Industrial Designer: but you have to say uh say that if you think that way .
User Interface: No I don't think {disfmarker} And the {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: And the company slogan , we thought in a kind of arc shape uh above the logo .
Project Manager: Yeah .
Marketing: Yeah .
Industrial Designer: That's basically what we were thinking about ,
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Okay .
Industrial Designer: and {disfmarker}
Project Manager: W
User Interface: And about the side view um {disfmarker} This the front won't be as thick ,
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: but again th the the drawing technique makes it very difficult to to really uh {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Well I see , but {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Oh and uh before I forget . Yeah the the voice , of course ,
Project Manager: Well . Yeah I see it .
Industrial Designer: the voice recorder is uh at the bottom .
Project Manager: Yes .
Industrial Designer: And you can record it uh using , yeah , the the the back of the f w device .
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: When I look at uh when I look at this side view , I think w when I have that in my hand , it's terrible .
User Interface: Well , it won't be visible . Mm ?
Project Manager: If if you look if if this this is thick , and this is thin , th th then it that it lies over your hands . But {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Why ? {vocalsound} Well it fits uh it it it it fits the hand , {vocalsound}
User Interface: Yeah .
Industrial Designer: mean uh the the the the {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Well what what what I what I agree is that when uh when um you have such of uh an arc in the middle , so that the the a the ends and the fronts is a bit thicker , so th then it falls over your hands .
Marketing: Yeah , I agree .
User Interface: {gap} If y {vocalsound} If you handle a remote , you you usually don't have your hand straight like this .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} In the middle in the {disfmarker}
User Interface: You you have it a bit uh {disfmarker} Yeah .
Marketing: It depends on the size . If it's kinda small , this is is great . But if it's it's larger , then you want to grab it .
Project Manager: And how large is it ?
User Interface: Yeah .
Marketing: Yeah , that's the question .
Industrial Designer: That's the question .
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Uh well {disfmarker} Yeah . H What do you suggest I mean we do ? {gap} This was Mike's prototype ,
Project Manager: Well uh {disfmarker}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: and y you seemed to agreed on it .
Project Manager: Well the sides I haven't seen yet , uh {gap} ?
Industrial Designer: But now you have a totally different {gap} .
User Interface: Well , they lay there all the time .
Industrial Designer: The size ? Yeah well the size doesn't really matter w I mean {disfmarker}
Project Manager: They the the the the the side view ,
Industrial Designer: Side ? Uh oh the side ?
Project Manager: we didn't uh {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: W we we he drew the s the side ,
User Interface: Yeah yeah .
Industrial Designer: but you d you weren't paying attention as usual .
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Well any case , we'll discuss it now . Uh I think uh this is a pretty good uh good idea {gap} .
Marketing: Yeah , I agree with the L_C_D_ screen . You have it in your palm like this , and you can watch uh watch the screen . And if you have it li in the middle , your hand might be over it .
Project Manager: Yeah .
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: But you you hold it like this .
User Interface: Yeah you you don't you don't grab it ,
Industrial Designer: You're not holding it like this or something .
User Interface: you you {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: You , yeah , y How do you call it ? Yeah .
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Well y y y you don't have it like this .
Project Manager: No no no .
Industrial Designer: You have it more like this .
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {gap} You you you're using buttons this way , or if you're right-handed , this way .
Marketing: Like you're holding your telephone .
Project Manager: Yep .
User Interface: Yeah .
Industrial Designer: So you {disfmarker} Yeah . So {disfmarker}
Marketing: Because if you have a screen on it , you wanna look at your screen .
User Interface: Hmm . That way , it it falls into your hand . I think . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Yeah well {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Okay .
Industrial Designer: And maybe you can you can grab it a bit higher ,
Marketing: Yeah , I agree on this .
Industrial Designer: so {disfmarker} Well {disfmarker}
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Marketing: No , I don't think so . That's not uh the point {disfmarker}
User Interface: No but but {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Well the the {disfmarker} Well that's a reason to to to put the L_C_D_ screen uh of course on the upper side , but {disfmarker}
User Interface: {vocalsound} Well f for as far as I can see , three of us agree
Project Manager: Yeah well
User Interface: and only Nils {disfmarker}
Project Manager: uh I think uh if you t if you three uh agree then then that's it .
User Interface: But you're the Project Manager , you can make the hard decisions . {vocalsound} {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Yes . So uh I c I c
Industrial Designer: If necessary .
Project Manager: Well , we'll we we'll do it like this .
Industrial Designer: But uh are d Can you live with it ? Uh {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Alright , if you think that that's the way it should {gap} {disfmarker}
User Interface: Yeah ?
Industrial Designer: Y Yeah , y y y y you said it was totally uh unusable .
Project Manager: No {disfmarker} No ,
Industrial Designer: But do you
Project Manager: when I I my personal taste is that I want it to fall over my hands with a thick {disfmarker} But {disfmarker} In the market uh {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: But d you don't think this is completely unusable I guess . I think .
Project Manager: No not totally .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Not totally , well {disfmarker}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} For me , I I wouldn't buy it . Let's say it like that .
Industrial Designer: Yeah but of course y you are also human . We have to take uh {vocalsound} every everyone into account . So {disfmarker}
Project Manager: No {gap} {disfmarker}
Marketing: And you might be uh {disfmarker} You might be target customer .
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
Project Manager: Yes but {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Well uh who who else thinks like you ?
User Interface: Mm .
Industrial Designer: We don't know .
Project Manager: Yeah , we don't know ,
Industrial Designer: Maybe a thousand people ,
Project Manager: but that's uh that's that's that's more market research .
Industrial Designer: or a million people .
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: So {vocalsound} let it be like this at uh at this moment .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Let it be .
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Okay ?
Industrial Designer: Alright . So that's that .
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Uh any other suggestions ?
Project Manager: No , I think it's great .
Marketing: Yeah .
User Interface: But what about the redesigning ?
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Comes to that later .
User Interface: Okay . {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Um you . Uh c You can uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Walter . {vocalsound} You can do the evaluation uh criteria on this ?
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} You're very personal again .
Marketing: {vocalsound} Alright . Great .
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: That's more useful than just {vocalsound} speaking .
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Well , this is just a short intro .
Project Manager: Yes .
Marketing: I'm going to do uh the ev evaluation . That's gonna be done at the end of seven point skill criteria .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Marketing: So I made a {disfmarker} I made a few questions on the hand of uh uh the impor most important requirements and trends .
Project Manager: Mm-hmm .
Marketing: And we have to look if our uh if our device uh is working correctly . Well , I put some questions in a Word file . See if I can find them . Uh uh uh uh mm .
Project Manager: 'Kay .
Marketing: Well {disfmarker}
User Interface: Hmm .
Marketing: I uh think you have all seen uh this kind of evaluation , so uh I don't have to explain it . Uh the first question is , uh is the device good-looking ? Because normal p uh most people thought that um earlier devices were ugly ugly . Seventy five percent of them . So what do we think ?
Industrial Designer: Well d we designed it , so of course we are very {disfmarker}
User Interface: Mm .
Project Manager: Yeah , we're we're not quite uh objective about this .
Marketing: Yeah {vocalsound} {disfmarker}
User Interface: Well we designed it to be good-looking .
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
Marketing: No , I know , but {vocalsound} I have to uh evaluate it . So I have to take this questionnaire .
Project Manager: To the customers ?
Industrial Designer: So and we ha we have answer now ?
Project Manager: To potential customers who have to take this questionnaire ?
Industrial Designer: Yeah . {gap}
Marketing: Yeah {vocalsound} {disfmarker} Yeah , but I can't can s
Project Manager: Nei . Oh no . I know , I know , I know .
User Interface: Hmm .
Project Manager: But um {disfmarker} Well {vocalsound} we can go , uh because of the time , uh pretty quick through this . Uh do we find it good-looking ? Well we think so . Uh {disfmarker}
User Interface: Yeah . We designed it to be good-looking , so {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: I {disfmarker} Yeah , I think it {disfmarker}
Marketing: Yeah , but uh , you know {disfmarker} We dis we di {vocalsound} we designed it to be perfect .
Project Manager: Yeah .
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: So {vocalsound} {disfmarker} But we have to be critic critical about it . And I have to uh take all these points and get a average at the end . So we {vocalsound} we know where we stand .
Project Manager: Well , one .
Industrial Designer: {gap}
Marketing: 'Cause th there are some things we might have uh bi might have forgotten .
Project Manager: Well so it's point four . Easy to find t
Industrial Designer: Well l well let's start with the beginning , just one by one . {vocalsound}
Marketing: Right , so {disfmarker} Right . Uh is it good-looking ?
Industrial Designer: Well , I guess uh I think uh {vocalsound} it's uh it's it's um pointed towards the youth of course , uh if you look at the design and and the colours and everything . {gap}
Project Manager: Two . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: That was our target audience of course . But it's also not completely um {vocalsound} uh u unacceptable for older people I guess . Uh it's it's not f a device that {disfmarker}
Marketing: The titanium might be uh f for older people .
Industrial Designer: Yeah , that's that's uh for older people , it's it's more that classical look . So {disfmarker}
Marketing: It you put uh put a black front on it or something .
User Interface: Hmm .
Industrial Designer: Uh no . {vocalsound} I think {disfmarker} Yeah they like black of course , but I think they'll uh they they think uh the the titanium look of it is also {disfmarker} Uh I think it's also good for them , so I think we both uh have uh consider considered uh the youth and also a bit older people . So I think it's very good-looking
Marketing: Right .
Industrial Designer: and not only for youth uh young people .
User Interface: I think we shouldn't discuss any points points that long , because I don't know how how many points there are but uh {disfmarker}
Project Manager: No . I totally agree .
Marketing: Right .
Industrial Designer: Yeah , the fourteen yeah .
Project Manager: We we have to get get on , go through this .
Marketing: Right , a number please .
User Interface: Yeah .
Industrial Designer: Is it easy to t change channels ? Yeah well I think so .
Marketing: So the last one is seven .
User Interface: Um , no it's uh {disfmarker}
Marketing: Easy to change channels ?
Project Manager: No , not false . It's one .
Marketing: Oh , sorry .
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Yeah , right .
Project Manager: Well uh two ? Y Well we have to go through it {gap} .
Marketing: Change channels ?
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} I think it's uh as easy as uh can be made . Uh {disfmarker}
Marketing: Right .
Industrial Designer: So I {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Yeah . You {disfmarker} How can you make it any easier ? {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound} With two huge buttons .
Marketing: The power , channel and volume buttons are easy accessible ?
Project Manager: Yep .
Industrial Designer: Yeah , huge is a {disfmarker} Yeah .
Project Manager: Two .
Marketing: Two ? Alright . The uh device is easy to find if you lose it ?
Project Manager: Well , no . We didn't implement anything about that . {gap}
Industrial Designer: D we d we don't we don't have uh that s
User Interface: Well it's easier to find than a a normal black one or something ,
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Well six then . {vocalsound}
User Interface: because of the colour . But {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
Marketing: Yeah . Six ? Right .
Industrial Designer: Well we don't have the device that beeps uh when you lost it or so ,
Project Manager: Are the functions easy to learn ?
Industrial Designer: but um um {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Well w I we do want we have a l f f less of an {disfmarker}
User Interface: {gap} We have so few functions , so {disfmarker} Yeah .
Marketing: Yeah , I agree .
Project Manager: And the device R_S_I_ sensitive ?
User Interface: Well , I should {disfmarker} I think two ,
Project Manager: Yeah .
User Interface: because {vocalsound} the voice recorder is n not self learning . {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Ah .
Marketing: Yeah . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Yeah . Yeah .
Project Manager: {gap}
Marketing: Alright . Two ?
Industrial Designer: Mm ?
Project Manager: Yeah , but just do some {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {gap} We we {disfmarker}
Marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah {vocalsound} {disfmarker}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} I th I th I think this is too time consuming .
Industrial Designer: Are we take too much time ?
Project Manager: Uh not not towards you ,
Marketing: Yeah , I agree .
Project Manager: but towards this all .
Marketing: No .
Project Manager: Th this is {gap} {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah .
Project Manager: We you have to put it to the customers .
Marketing: Right , R_ R_S_I_ sensitive ? {vocalsound} R_S_I_ sensitive ?
Project Manager: Uh well well a bit , so four .
Marketing: Four . Um {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Yes .

Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Uh those uh nine uh is the fancy-looking . Uh we still think so .
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
Project Manager: Device fancy feeling .
Industrial Designer: And I think fancy-feeling too ,
Project Manager: Yeah , cool man .
User Interface: Yeah .
Industrial Designer: because of the titanium back . Yeah .
Marketing: Right .
Project Manager: Are there enough technology ? Yeah well also we have two .
User Interface: Yeah .
Marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah , that's great .
Project Manager: Is the device easy to use ?
User Interface: The {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Yes we have {vocalsound} not many buttons .
Industrial Designer: So well maybe two
Project Manager: Two , three .
User Interface: Two {vocalsound} two .
Industrial Designer: because of the voice recorder .
Marketing: Well , with the uh {disfmarker} Three .
Project Manager: Are the trends about fruit and vegetables implemented ?
User Interface: T

Industrial Designer: Yeah . One or two . Yeah .
User Interface: One or two , another two .
Marketing: Nah f four I think .
Industrial Designer: Four ?
Marketing: {vocalsound} If you look at this {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Well , it doesn't really resemble any fruit , uh that's true .
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: But but we have the the the the the sparkly fruity colours of course .
Marketing: No .
Project Manager: Oh okay . Okay {gap} .
User Interface: Well three .
Marketing: Three , alright .
Industrial Designer: And you can also have {gap} front with uh with fruit on it . {vocalsound}
Marketing: Yeah , that's true .
Project Manager: Is the material attractive ?
Marketing: But {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
User Interface: Mm . Yeah .
Project Manager: Well the titanium is strong , and uh the rest f uh the buttons feel soft . So I would say at least two .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Right .
Project Manager: Okay .
User Interface: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Well {disfmarker} Yeah .
User Interface: This is the last meeting ?
Project Manager: Yes , but we we have to design much more ,
User Interface: Yeah .
Marketing: The average will uh come later .
Project Manager: because there was some irritating account manager coming to me . {vocalsound} Um {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: I knew things uh were going uh too smoothly .
Project Manager: Oh . Uh {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: There had to be some kind of trouble along the way .
User Interface: Yeah . {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Yes . Well , look at the costs at this point .
Industrial Designer: My god .
Project Manager: I had to fit it in .
Marketing: It has to go to twelve , right ?
Project Manager: I twelve and a half .
Marketing: Twelve and a half .
Project Manager: So {disfmarker} Well what costs a lot ? The sample spea costs four .
Industrial Designer: The what ?
Project Manager: The sample speaker ,
Industrial Designer: The {disfmarker}
Marketing: Out .
Project Manager: the s sensor .
Marketing: That's easy . Kick it out .
Project Manager: Kick it out .
User Interface: The what ?
Project Manager: We have to go to twelve and a half .
Marketing: Yeah . The speaker .
Project Manager: The speaker costs far , by far the most .
User Interface: Oh .
Industrial Designer: Yeah w tha that's uh that's a bit an optional option .
Marketing: That's some wrong info , man . {vocalsound}
Project Manager: It it isn't worth it .
Industrial Designer: No . No , d th No .
Marketing: No .
Project Manager: We could make two different versions , one with and one without .
Marketing: It's uh {disfmarker}
Project Manager: But for this {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Marketing: It's just extra . Kick it out .
Project Manager: So , zero .
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Then we go to fourteen point six .
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
Project Manager: Well the titanium I don't want to lose actually .
Marketing: What more ?
Industrial Designer: No .
Marketing: {vocalsound} Batteries are uh quite {disfmarker}
Project Manager: L_C_ three ? Yeah hand dynamo ? Y t come on ,
Marketing: {vocalsound} Uh no , no no no .
Project Manager: w a remote control has a battery .
User Interface: Um {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: N Uh well we have a bit of a problem I think .
User Interface: Well well why why why should we use a advanced chip ?
Industrial Designer: Because uh {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Well be for the L_C_D_ uh you had said .
Industrial Designer: {gap} the L_C_D_ screen . Yeah .
User Interface: Yeah ?
Marketing: Hmm .
User Interface: Can't we do that with a regular chip ?
Industrial Designer: No .
User Interface: Why not ?
Industrial Designer: Because uh that uh y {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Well what what's the difference between simple and regular ?
Industrial Designer: because my information says it .
Project Manager: What's the difference between a simple and a regular chip ?
Industrial Designer: Huh ?
User Interface: Yeah . Regular is normal .
Marketing: Yeah .
Project Manager: And simple ?
Industrial Designer: Uh well yeah I I read something about it , but {disfmarker}
User Interface: Simple .
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Nothing .
User Interface: {vocalsound} Elementary .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Well {gap} ?
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah ,
Project Manager: Your part .
Industrial Designer: I I read something about it , but it wasn't very clear . I d I didn't in include it in my report .
Project Manager: What happens if we do {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Single {disfmarker} Well you have to use a chip . So {disfmarker} Well you have to use the advanced chip , if you have the L_C_D_ screen .
Project Manager: How much do we win ? One .
User Interface: We we we {disfmarker} Why ?
Project Manager: {gap}
User Interface: We have very little options furthermore , for the {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Yeah .
Industrial Designer: But if you have a regular chip , you can't have the L_C_D_ screen .
User Interface: Uh well we have to put that in .
Marketing: Yeah , we need to have the {vocalsound} the L_C_D_ screen .
Industrial Designer: That that's a fact . Uh {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Well , we could say , well this special colour , that isn't that that isn't there ,
Marketing: No {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Project Manager: because the the fronts they will buy it . The special colour .

User Interface: Nah .
Industrial Designer: Uh it d it doesn't {disfmarker}
Marketing: No , that's n It's not relevant .
Project Manager: Yeah ,
User Interface: Yeah , you must change the chip uh back .
Project Manager: then you s then you only have one half left .
User Interface: You must change the chip back , Nils .
Marketing: Yeah .
Project Manager: Uh yeah .
Industrial Designer: But we d Then we have to lose the L_C_D_ screen .
Marketing: No , {vocalsound} {disfmarker} Then the whole concept is uh
Industrial Designer: Yeah , I know but that's what my information says . I di I didn't uh put uh the advanced chip in there for fun . {vocalsound}
User Interface: Hmm . {vocalsound} No {vocalsound} we oh {vocalsound} {disfmarker}
Marketing: You {disfmarker} You can make you can make it cheaper .
Industrial Designer: You have to use it .
Marketing: But if you don't sell
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Yeah .
User Interface: You you we have an advanced chip-on-print ,
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: and we have an L_C_ display . I think that's a bit double .
Project Manager: Yeah ? No , {vocalsound}
User Interface: Y we don't need both .
Project Manager: the advanced chip is needed to have an L_C_D_ display .
Industrial Designer: For the L_C_D_ screen . Yeah . Yeah .
User Interface: Says {gap} .
Project Manager: Says , his {disfmarker} Uh that was in the second meeting , I think .
Industrial Designer: Well uh and what do they mean with curves uh again ? Because we you have uncurved {vocalsound} {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Well I I did single curve to {disfmarker} Well you said s double curved ,
User Interface: I ?
Project Manager: uh he ,
User Interface: {gap} ?
Project Manager: because uh I thought it's a b a bit cheaper already .
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
Project Manager: We can also make it flat .
Industrial Designer: Well {disfmarker}
Marketing: {gap} No
Industrial Designer: But what what did what do n
Marketing: no no no .
Project Manager: But {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Sorry , but {disfmarker} {vocalsound} What do they mean with the curves ?

Project Manager: Yes , that's curved .
Industrial Designer: One curve ?
Project Manager: Yes .
Industrial Designer: Yeah , this is actually two curves , yeah .
Project Manager: No , it's one curve .
Industrial Designer: It's how you {disfmarker} It's how you look at it .
User Interface: {vocalsound} One curve . {vocalsound}
Project Manager: One curve , simple .
Industrial Designer: Well then we have a huge problem I think .
Marketing: {gap}
Industrial Designer: W t we can never get uh below the twelve and a half .
Project Manager: We have a big financial problem .
User Interface: Well we make it more expensive to buy .
Project Manager: Well , then we have two dollars less profit . Come on , if we if we if we make this fifty million , they won't hesitate to uh congratulate us , so uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {gap}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: If if you make people brand-aware , they are willing to pay more . But {disfmarker} Because we we use a brand at the front and uh I dun at the back . If you have uh lots of uh marketing people might buy .
Industrial Designer: But uh I {disfmarker}
User Interface: Yeah or we could replace it {disfmarker}
Marketing: If you if you make it cool to have {disfmarker}
Project Manager: By the way , we also have this one .
Marketing: Oh , that's just great .
Project Manager: Oh , costs nothing . That's nice . {vocalsound}
Marketing: Oh , alright . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Hey but uh I think you'll agree that uh that we that now we have this uh screen , it's it's very uh not practical to ha to consider this after we have designed the entire thing .
Project Manager: Plastic is {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Yes , but I just got it .
Marketing: {gap}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Well that's pretty uh l
User Interface: Why why don't we replace the titanium with uh plastic coloured titanium ,
Marketing: That is pretty stupid . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: N not very practical . {vocalsound} Well {disfmarker}
User Interface: uh titanium-coloured plastic ?
Project Manager: Who ?
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: You want to dump the titanium ?
User Interface: Yeah well if we uh we we have to get cheaper .
Project Manager: And make all plastic , then we ha then we're there .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} But I'm n I don't agree .
User Interface: But then we we've got to uh run through the eval evaluation process again .
Industrial Designer: I think {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Th then you have a ugly , stupid , l ugly looking , dumb remote that that no-one would buy .
User Interface: Ah no no .
Marketing: {vocalsound}
User Interface: It's not ugly looking . The looks remain the same .
Project Manager: No , I don't think so .
User Interface: Well , I do think so .
Industrial Designer: I think the titanium just uh provided the the tough look and the and the {disfmarker}
Marketing: Y
Project Manager: Yes . And the feel ,
User Interface: {gap} feel .
Project Manager: and th that it is strong , and {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: And also the the older people will like it because of that . And because i
Marketing: Yeah , I agree .
Industrial Designer: Alright it's not our target audience , but it's it's useful if it's uh important for old people .
Project Manager: We still {vocalsound} we had to focus to get more people from the younger group ,
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
Project Manager: but not lose the one {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} I think the titanium is very important .
User Interface: Yeah alright but then we we won't get there .
Industrial Designer: Yeah we have a problem , yeah . W But you can better , yeah , dump the L_C_D_ screen then .
User Interface: We can dump the special colour . We l we use plastic . And plastic is already in colour I think .
Marketing: I don't think you should dump the L_C_D_ screen .
Industrial Designer: Well what else ?
User Interface: No , nothing .
Industrial Designer: W I mean uh {disfmarker}
Marketing: Or you shou {vocalsound} It's {disfmarker}
User Interface: Amen .
Marketing: Or change the titanium or dump the L_C_D_ screen . But I think you could better change uh titanium to hard a hard kind of plastic looking like titanium than lose the L_C_D_ screen .
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
User Interface: Yeah .
Marketing: Because you have lots of functions {vocalsound} in it too .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah , well yeah . Alright .
User Interface: Yeah .
Project Manager: Why can't I {disfmarker}
User Interface: But {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: I agree with that . So we u we use uh {disfmarker} Unfortunately . Um . Titanium-coloured plastic .
Project Manager: I'll put in the report we that we think that fourteen point one is the l m lowest price you can make a remote for that's trendy d these days .
Marketing: Yeah , I agree .
Industrial Designer: So titanium-coloured plastic for the back .
Project Manager: I I'll talk to the managers . {vocalsound}
User Interface: No no no no . W Titanium stays there .
Project Manager: Titanium , I thi I think this this is this is e really good re remote . But {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Yeah this is good ,
Marketing: Osl {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: but it it's not good enough . {vocalsound} So we have to use the ditch the titanium , I'm afraid .
Project Manager: Ah those {gap} those account managers , what do th d what do they know ?
User Interface: Well {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Come on . Riot . {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: What do we {disfmarker} Well what do we know ? All we want is a is a fancy design but we don't really consider the costs . So {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Yes , yes .
User Interface: No because we did not know anything about it .
Project Manager: One and a half Euros . Hmm ?
Industrial Designer: Yeah al alright , yeah .
Marketing: If you don't have the money , you can't make it .
Industrial Designer: But we have to deal with it now . So {disfmarker}
Marketing: So s If you don't have the money , you can't make it . So this is too expensive .
Project Manager: So ?
Industrial Designer: So {disfmarker}
Marketing: So we have to make it cheaper .
Industrial Designer: Titanium gone and add plastic .
User Interface: Yeah , but then we've got money left .
Marketing: Right .
Industrial Designer: And on plastic times two and then we uh are there ?
Project Manager: Well , no it's just uh all plastic .
Industrial Designer: No {disfmarker}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Well alright . Huh .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} No yeah well {disfmarker}
Project Manager: {gap} {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Oh six . {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound} It's just free , man .
Industrial Designer: A lot of plastic , yeah . {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Four . So {disfmarker}

Project Manager: But then we can add the special colour ? As we have money over uh left . {vocalsound}
User Interface: Yeah .
Project Manager: And we still have money left .
User Interface: Yeah . W
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: What do we want , guys ?

User Interface: Well I think uh the case is double curved then .
Project Manager: Yes .
User Interface: Because you y have that curve
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} We have we have to uh fill {disfmarker}
User Interface: and you have that curve .
Project Manager: Y Oh no . {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound} Well , th that that is the problem .
User Interface: Yeah well uh {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: W we ha {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Alright .
Industrial Designer: No no no , but th that's not f um {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Safe .
User Interface: Well y we have curves in all directions .
Industrial Designer: Well you can you can double curve , if you don't have titanium . And that we dropped ,
Project Manager: So {disfmarker} alright .
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: so it it can be done . {vocalsound} But it's pretty funny . We we do want to reach twelve point five . But it isn't bad to to to stay at eleven .
Project Manager: Finance ?
User Interface: I mean , this this ain't titanium , but it looks like it .
Project Manager: Well , guys ?
Industrial Designer: We get more salary , if we make if cheaper than twelve uh twelve and a half .
Marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah .
Project Manager: Guys ?
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: We have to dump our titanium ,
Marketing: Shoot .
Project Manager: and we'll hate the managers for that , but now we're going to evaluate our project , of uh project ,
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Objection .
User Interface: Pro project . {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} project . {vocalsound} Well , {vocalsound} satisfaction on for example , are we satisfactory about our creativity ?
Industrial Designer: Well I can't get no satisfaction , but uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: I think it's uh {disfmarker} Well in in if we consider the costs then this is the best , yeah .

Project Manager: I think it's terrible that we got uh those costs at the last moment .
Marketing: Yeah .
User Interface: Yeah . Yeah .
Marketing: Yeah , me too .
Project Manager: That's really bad . But that that that's that , yeah that's a reason ,
Industrial Designer: Its it's uh ridiculous actually , but {disfmarker}
User Interface: And uh unrealistic .
Project Manager: but also for our creativity . We had um nice design , and then you get the cost , and you had to dump all your creativity .
User Interface: Well we we we used our creativity ,
Marketing: Right .
User Interface: but we just had to adapt it to the costs .
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Which isn't very practical ,
Project Manager: Yeah .
User Interface: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Nei . Uh no . {vocalsound}

User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: But o alright , the teamwork ?
Industrial Designer: Well uh they they didn't think of the requirements .
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: It's the requirements of the user , uh I guess .
Project Manager: No they said , oh we won't d uh we won't uh use teletext , uh we won't use the D_V_D_ . {vocalsound} {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah . Yeah but they base that on on the user specifications .
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Alright , teamwork ? Well great I think .
Marketing: Well {disfmarker}
User Interface: Right yeah . {gap}
Marketing: Yeah , think so too .

Project Manager: Yes .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah alright . For drawings ,
Project Manager: For drawings , yes .

Project Manager: But for notes , it i you you have to put that in a strict {disfmarker} Uh you have to put a name , standard date , and all those things . And notes uh for a meeting are very strict . So if you uh were to write them down for yourself , and then put that in your computer , you still have to type it over to Word .
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: So it doesn't d doesn't have any {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Marketing: Yeah , right .
