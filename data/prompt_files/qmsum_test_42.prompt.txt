So {vocalsound} now we have to think about what we will make . First I wanna hear from you . Uh what are your experiences with remote controls . So {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Uh I will start .
Project Manager: F first {gap} .
Industrial Designer: Uh {disfmarker} {gap}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Big one , they are uh not easy to use . Um I have one set and uh a remote control , when I dropped it , uh it broke . So that won't be uh our goal , I think .
User Interface: No .
Industrial Designer: And uh g big buttons , {vocalsound} m uh that's easier to use than uh {disfmarker} I think . Not all the small buttons , you don't know {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Is this positive or negative , that uh big buttons ?
Industrial Designer: Big buttons , positive .
Project Manager: Positive .
Industrial Designer: All all small buttons like when you have uh like a hundred buttons on your remote control , you won't know what they're working for .
Project Manager: Okay . What are your experiences ?
User Interface: Uh well I think the the the goal of a remote control is that it's it it has an influence on the T_V_ set .
Project Manager: Mm .
User Interface: And that it controls the channels and the the volume . And uh I I I think it's positive if there's a a LED uh uh a LED on the corner of the of the remote . So that you know it s it still has batteries on it {disfmarker} in it . And that if you push the button the LED uh gives a light , and uh and you see that it's working . And uh yeah . Uh {disfmarker}
Project Manager: So and do they always have that ?
User Interface: Yeah , but {disfmarker} No no no . But I {disfmarker} my my experience is that it it it's convenient to have that .
Project Manager: It's easy to you .
User Interface: Yeah . Yeah .
Project Manager: Okay . 'Kay .
Marketing: Uh at home we have a T_V_ , a video uh recorder , a D_V_D_ player , and a satellite receiver . We have uh four distinctive remote controls for that .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Thank you .
Marketing: That's not really ea easy .
Industrial Designer: Help also . {vocalsound} Thank you .
Marketing: So it would be nice if we have one for all . And we also had a remote control for our radio set . But um i it it had a lot of buttons on it , and you didn't know which one was what . And it was uh uh v {vocalsound} not easy to use . So we n barely used it .
Project Manager: Okay so they have too much . So next .
User Interface: Hmm .
Project Manager: For our own remote control we have to think how do we make it . So what ideas do you have for it , for the new remote control ? What what does it have to have ? {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: The weight . Not not too heavy .
Project Manager: Not too heavy . Yes .
Industrial Designer: Not much buttons .
Project Manager: Yeah .
Industrial Designer: Bust-free . That when you drop it , it won't break . Like uh some kind of rubber on it . Or hard uh hard plastic . Uh buttons not too small . Uh something like when you uh lose your uh remote control , sometimes it happen . Uh it between the couch and you can't find it .
Project Manager: Yes .
Industrial Designer: When you push a but a button on the T_V_ , then you hear some {gap} {disfmarker} uh some sort of bleep .
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Like a phone .
Industrial Designer: And then you uh , hey there there's remote control .
Project Manager: Okay .
Marketing: Yeah .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: So ,
Industrial Designer: Next .
Project Manager: that's {gap} .
User Interface: Yeah well that's {disfmarker} that are good ideas . Uh {disfmarker} Yeah well the LED on the corner , that that indicates that it's working . If you push a button . Um {disfmarker} Yeah . And looking on the budget , not too expensive uh material . So probably plastic or something . Uh {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Okay .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Yeah I think it uh {disfmarker} from a marketing point of view , it also has to look nice . Or you won't sell it .
Project Manager: Yes .
Marketing: And um yeah uh on our website we can see what products we already have . And it should work with as many uh as possible of them .
Project Manager: Okay . This is {disfmarker} It has to be compatible with other things .
Marketing: Yes .
Project Manager: Okay .
Industrial Designer: I have one more idea . Just popped up .
Project Manager: Yes ?
Industrial Designer: Uh it it won't take a lot of batteries . So you don't {disfmarker} won't have to change the batteries uh once a week or uh once every two weeks .
Project Manager: No battery use . So more ideas ?
User Interface: Mm no .
Project Manager: No okay . It's only the first ideas . So {vocalsound} uh what are we going to do now is {disfmarker} Next meeting is in half an h hour . Uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Okay .
