Project Manager: Okay . Uh door is closed . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Well , let's begin . Because if we have as much time as the last uh meeting , we'll have to hurry up .
Marketing: I'm listening .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Right .
Project Manager: Um well I'll start with the presentation again , the agenda .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Great .
Project Manager: Yo . So . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} This one I think .
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Uh yeah . Well alright . Um well , I'll show you the notes . It's not as uh interesting as it should be because we just uh had the meeting ,
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: but I'll show them . We'll get your presentations again on the conceptual design . Um {disfmarker} Then we'll have to dec decide about the control , the remote control concepts . I've put a f uh a file in the project management folder , which says exactly uh what kind of decisions we should take .
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm .
Project Manager: So {vocalsound} this time we exactly know what to decide about .
Marketing: {vocalsound} Alright , great .
Project Manager: And then we'll close again .
Industrial Designer: Alright .
Project Manager: Uh {disfmarker} Well these are some examples , but we'll talk about them later . We'll {vocalsound} first look at your uh presentations . Alright ?
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm .
Project Manager: Walter will uh start again this time ?
Marketing: Yeah , great .
Project Manager: Yo .
Marketing: Alright , Trendwatch .
Project Manager: 'Kay .
Marketing: {gap}
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Right . I will speak about uh latest trends trends , latest fashion updates , and uh things we must not do .
Project Manager: 'Kay .
Marketing: Uh the trends . {vocalsound} It's very important that uh the control is fancy looking and good uh feeling . Uh this because of our last model was very functional , but {vocalsound} it uh people didn't like that , so our new mo model must be very good-looking . That's uh something you uh have to take a look at .
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm . Alright .
Marketing: And uh the feeling has to be very great . Also the menus and things like that they have to they have to feel great .
Industrial Designer: Alright .
Marketing: Um there's a minus uh two times here , because this is the most important point . This is uh two times as less important ,
Project Manager: Less . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: and uh same for this one . {vocalsound} Um , technological technological innovations , that's uh regarded very highly too .
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Uh such as an uh L_C_D_ screen , uh speech uh acknowledgement , as we uh talked about earlier .
Project Manager: Well , yeah .
Marketing: So we have to have uh something like that , like we uh {disfmarker}
Project Manager: L_C_D_ and our uh our fronts .
Marketing: Right . {vocalsound} Uh the last point is easy to use . Well I think that uh speaks for s for itself . I don't know who's uh who's going to look at that .
Industrial Designer: Easy to use ?
Project Manager: Well , easy to use uh s is a bit uh contradictionary with the first uh {disfmarker}
Marketing: Yeah ?
Industrial Designer: I think that's your ta
User Interface: {gap}
Project Manager: Functional is not an issue , and then easy to use .
Marketing: Yeah , I know .
Project Manager: Well we have to choose one of them . {vocalsound}
Marketing: I think we have to go for the first one .
Project Manager: Yeah . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Mm .
Marketing: It's the most important one . So {gap} we have to uh take that one .
Project Manager: Okay .
Marketing: So it it {vocalsound} it isn't very important that {vocalsound} that it works easy .
User Interface: Well something fancy looking can be can be easy to use .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound} But {vocalsound} it has to look great .
Project Manager: Yeah . We'll we'll look at uh {gap} .
Industrial Designer: You {disfmarker} Yeah . Yeah , yeah ,
Marketing: We'll see . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: you can make a very complicated uh uh remote anyway , so ease of use {disfmarker} {vocalsound} It's not a very comp complicated device .
Marketing: Yeah , right . But the most important thing is that it looks great and people say {gap} wow , that's real great uh great concept .
Project Manager: 'Kay .
Industrial Designer: Alright .
Marketing: Alright . Uh these are the new colours of this year .
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: So it must be very bright , very colourful .
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}
Marketing: People like this .
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: So we we have to think uh in this direction .
Project Manager: So {disfmarker}
Marketing: So i set your mind to it .
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Well {disfmarker}
Marketing: Findings ? Fashion update ? Fruit and vegetables are cool .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Uh you think ?
Marketing: I am told . {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: The group we are targeting is uh very pleased with fruit and vegetables .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: So {vocalsound} we we we might cons consider in front of uh in in that sort of uh way .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Yeah , well {disfmarker}
User Interface: Bananas .
Marketing: Uh furthermore uh material , that's your part , should be very strong . I was thinking of something like uh {vocalsound} well uh iron plate over it ,
Industrial Designer: Mm .
Marketing: maybe in a colour or something ,
Project Manager: Yeah .
Marketing: that looks so f really flashy but it it is also strong .
Industrial Designer: {gap}
Project Manager: B
Marketing: And that's uh also for the younger public .
Project Manager: Well the the handy thing about our fronts is that we can follow these trends e ev every year . Th this year it's fruits but next year it's it's something totally different .
Marketing: Yeah , that's great .
User Interface: Yeah .
Marketing: But I think we can all make the the fronts of titanium or something uh really thin .
Project Manager: Yes .
Marketing: So it looks very heavy but you can still uh use it very easily .
Project Manager: Yep , alright .
Industrial Designer: Mm .
Marketing: Well , the don'ts . Older people like dark colours and simple shapes . Well we don't want uh older people ,
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: we want young people .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} {gap}
Marketing: So uh we're gonna turn that around .
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Alright .
Marketing: We're gonna have real uh cool shapes and lots of colours . Right ?
Project Manager: Wood is popular . Aha .
Marketing: Okay . We don't want wood .
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah yeah yeah .
Industrial Designer: Yeah , among the old people , yeah .
Marketing: Old people . So , that's it for me .
Project Manager: Alright . Nice , uh well {gap} show us .
Industrial Designer: Right , I am going to tell you something about the components design . Uh again I have uh put up the specification properties . This uh so um uh the different uh components of the of of the device . And the materials ? Um I have heard several things , so I uh I'll have to change that on the way . But uh the case ? Uh I suggested uh in the previous meeting hard plastic . But uh as you indicated uh it should be strong .
Marketing: Yeah , we should change that .
Industrial Designer: It should feel strong . So maybe plastic is not uh sufficient .
Project Manager: Well maybe it it it is ,
Industrial Designer: We should move to uh something {disfmarker}
Project Manager: but it doesn't look strong . So maybe {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Well yeah . Y Hard plastic i is of course uh pretty pretty tough , but it doesn't have a really really tough look . So {disfmarker}
Marketing: No no no .
Project Manager: But we still have to look at our price of course . Because uh if we want an L_C_D_ uh window etcetera uh {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Yeah . Also {disfmarker} Yeah . Mm-hmm . But we'll return to that .
Project Manager: Yeah ?
Industrial Designer: Uh the buttons of course rubber , I think everyone agrees . And electrical cables , copper is all pretty basic stuff . The chips made of silicon , I guess . I think that's the best uh way to do it .
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: And infra infrared l LED is uh just a simple bulb .
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Then I've uh {vocalsound} had a few findings , made a few findings . Uh the target audience product style . Um it's uh um generally the case that uh senior and wealthy people above uh forty five years old uh like , as you said , uh particularly the traditional materials as such as wood and materials such as that . They also like straightforward shapes and luxurious style . But of course that's not our uh things this . So this is things we must not do .
Project Manager: Yes .
Industrial Designer: And then we have uh young uh and dynamic uh people , which is of course our uh group , the people we aim at . Um under forty five years old . Uh they like soft materials uh with primary colours . Soft materials is of course uh agai again a bit a contradiction with uh our uh material choice of what you said , that uh it should be hard an and and and and strong looking .
Marketing: Mm . Yeah .
User Interface: Yeah .
Industrial Designer: But they like soft materials , uh so we might uh we have to consider that . And also they like curved round shapes . So not uh too formal like like uh the older people want . And if uh also a finding but not very ap applicable here , that sports and gaming devices such as uh discmans for jogging and that those kind of devices , gaming devices , should define the characteristics of the device . But uh since we don't have a really a sports or gaming device , so we don't really have to consider that .
Project Manager: Sports uh , they're uh that uh are accessible on on your L_C_D_ uh window uh
User Interface: Soccer fronts . {vocalsound} Mm .
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {disfmarker} Huh ? {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Mm .
Project Manager: That's nice . {vocalsound}
User Interface: Hmm .
Project Manager: All the {gap} results ?
Industrial Designer: Well I also have um several examples of uh styles ,
Marketing: We keep coming back to the fronts . {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
User Interface: Yeah . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: so you can get a clear picture of uh what I mean .
Project Manager: Yeah .
Industrial Designer: Uh {vocalsound} these are the basic uh older older peoples' stuff .
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Yeah .
Marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah .
Industrial Designer: It was not very uh interesting uh , very classical looking ,
Project Manager: Mm-hmm . {vocalsound} Nai . Uh no .
Industrial Designer: but that's n that's not what we want .
User Interface: Hmm .
Industrial Designer: We have these kind of things . I don't know what exactly they are .
Marketing: {vocalsound} Fruity . {vocalsound} Fruity .
Industrial Designer: It looks like {disfmarker} Well you know uh you recognise the shapes ,
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: it's very primary colours , uh bright colours and uh round shapes .
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: You also uh {vocalsound} see uh this device , it's not very round and {disfmarker} Fruity of course . Yeah , it uh {disfmarker}
Project Manager: It's t terrible .
Industrial Designer: That's true .
Project Manager: Alright .
Industrial Designer: And uh well round shapes , primary colours .
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: You can see it all here . And of course uh this famous device .
Project Manager: Hmm ?
Industrial Designer: I think as you know something uh some devices like this .
Project Manager: Yeah , alright .
Industrial Designer: So to give you an idea of uh {disfmarker}
Marketing: Well it's got a strong look , this . Yeah .
Industrial Designer: This has a strong look . Although it's plastic , it's it's grey to to to give it iron look .
Marketing: Yeah , it still has a strong look .
Project Manager: Yeah . And it's round .
Industrial Designer: That's uh {disfmarker}
Marketing: But then you are losing your fruity colours .
Industrial Designer: Yeah . Well we have to make a {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Well you can make th th th that middle ring can you you can make another colour . So uh those kind of things you can you can combine .
Marketing: That's true .
Industrial Designer: Well we can't really make a round uh a round remote control . I don't think that's very practical ,
Project Manager: No , it isn't .
Industrial Designer: but {disfmarker} But uh it's important to to uh to think about the colour .
Project Manager: Okay .
Industrial Designer: Because if we make it grey or or silvery looking , it it does make it a lot more uh does make it looking a lot more stronger .
Project Manager: Yes .
Industrial Designer: 'Cause if you look at this , it it doesn't look very very strong ,
Marketing: Yeah but the {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: becau But this is plastic , and and this too , but {disfmarker}
Marketing: But it doesn't have to look strong . The the results are , the feel of the material is expected to be strongy .
Industrial Designer: The feel ? Uh alright .
Marketing: The feel .
Project Manager: So , if you ti
Industrial Designer: Well {disfmarker}
User Interface: And it it doesn't have to be strong , also .
Project Manager: Well {disfmarker}
Marketing: Nah yeah the feel {disfmarker}
Project Manager: You you {disfmarker} Maybe you should have uh some some coloured titanium or something .
User Interface: {vocalsound} Only the feel . {vocalsound}
Project Manager: So it it looks pretty but it feels strong .
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm .
Marketing: Right .
User Interface: Oh .
Industrial Designer: And I {disfmarker} Then I have some more findings . Um {vocalsound} uh about the energy energy source of the of the device ,
Marketing: I agree .
Industrial Designer: uh I uh suggest uh the basic battery . I uh got some other um uh uh energy sources of course . But solar energy is not very practical inside a house , because you don't have a have a lot of uh sun .
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: And uh kinetic and and and dynamos are are not very practical , I think , for uh for a simple remote ,
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: that's a bit , oh , that's a bit uh {disfmarker} That's a bit uh much .
Project Manager: {vocalsound} {gap} No titanium . {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: And I also suggest uh as a shape uh a double curved case .
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Uh the disadvantage of that that you can use no titanium . That that's the information I received . If you use the curved case , uh a curved case , double curved then you can't use titanium .
Project Manager: What do you exactly mean with double curved ?
Industrial Designer: Now uh this uh to give it a more modern look .
User Interface: {gap}
Industrial Designer: And uh {vocalsound} now the the shape , yeah , {gap} a curved case . Um yeah I think uh sort of triangle-shaped bottom or something . Uh {gap} a more modern look not plain , long box style , but {disfmarker}
Marketing: {vocalsound} I dunno .
Project Manager: Double curved ?
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} I'll draw it ,
Project Manager: It it mean {disfmarker}
User Interface: Yeah . Yeah . {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Yeah , well okay . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: but maybe later .
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} And it makes uh it gives it a more u user friendly shape , than if you have uh {gap} . Um anyway {disfmarker}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Um f as uh for the buttons , simple push buttons . No uh otherwi uh no um difficult scroll things or some uh things like that , because it makes more complex and expensive . And , uh as we agreed , we don't use a speaker or a sensor or um {vocalsound} uh speak uh speech uh controlled {vocalsound} device .
Marketing: Yeah right . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Because it makes it also more complex and expensive . But we do use an L_C_D_ screen , so we uh we do have to consider uh of we have to use a more advanced chip , which is more complex and expensive . But {disfmarker} It's worth the trouble I think ,
Project Manager: Well {disfmarker}
User Interface: The buttons can be made of an uh a soft material .
Industrial Designer: because {disfmarker}
User Interface: Because people like that .
Project Manager: This soft material thing from uh {disfmarker} Yeah .
Industrial Designer: Uh rubber is a soft material , I guess .
User Interface: Yeah . Right . Yeah .
Industrial Designer: Uh soft enough .
Marketing: Yeah . Right .
Industrial Designer: So that's uh basically what I want to talk about .
Project Manager: Alright . Okay . We will take that . And then uh Mike ? Okay .
User Interface: Yeah . Well um nah the method um we will um include the buttons as we discussed uh earlier . Um an L_C_D_ s screen will be implemented . Um we must decide where , this meeting .
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
User Interface: Um there are new developments in speech recognition um systems , {vocalsound} um and they are already being uh used on uh coffee machines . And um well they're cheap , so we could use them now .
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Oh {disfmarker} That's interesting .
User Interface: Um it's not really speech recognition , it's more um like you can um talk to the chip , uh record the message and record an answer , and then once you uh talk to the remote , then um he will a answer with the the prerecorded message that you left . So if I say hi Mike , and you have recorded uh hi Mike back , then you will get that .
Industrial Designer: Oh , yeah , I understand . Yeah .
Marketing: Oh okay . {gap}
Project Manager: Okay . But you can also say that , when you say something , it does some function .
Marketing: Right .
User Interface: No it doesn't does not do anything .
Marketing: No .
Project Manager: Oh . That's a bit uh {disfmarker}
User Interface: But i it's just a {disfmarker}
Marketing: But that that makes it cheap .
Project Manager: Yes . I understand .
User Interface: Yeah it's it's cheap .
Industrial Designer: Yeah . {vocalsound}
Marketing: It's {vocalsound} it's just a an extra function ,
Project Manager: But {vocalsound} it has no functionality for our remote at all .
Marketing: and it's cheap .
User Interface: No
Marketing: No but {vocalsound} {disfmarker}
User Interface: but that's the gadget they want , or the gimmicks .
Marketing: Yeah , right . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: But it it's n nice for young people .
Marketing: Young people love them .
User Interface: Yes , we we should really uh include that one , I think . Um {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: They like gadgets . Yeah .
Marketing: Yeah , ple Right .
Project Manager: Hmm .
Industrial Designer: If it's cheap . Yeah .
User Interface: Well , as I said uh earlier I think the uh L_C_D_ screen should be uh positioned at the lower end of the remote .
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
User Interface: Um the buttons for screen width and general settings and {gap} uh and that kind of stuff {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
User Interface: um we can also do let that kind of functions um be shown in the L_C_D_ screen , uh instead of uh extra buttons .
Project Manager: So you put a menu in the L_C_D_ ?
User Interface: I think young people and yeah w well every user would like that . Um the buttons um should be positioned uh positioned the same way as they are on a , well , conventional remote , I think . For the learnability and uh well to keep it recognisable . A voice recognition can be uh implemented . And uh I drew an example ,
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: but it did not work quite the well uh the way I wanted it to do .
Marketing: {vocalsound} Alright .
Industrial Designer: Can you draw it now of uh {disfmarker}
Marketing: How {disfmarker} How {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Ah .
User Interface: Hmm ? Well I have the {disfmarker} I can draw it again ,
Industrial Designer: Can you draw it now ?
User Interface: and I know what I did wrong . I didn't tick the note bo box in the {gap} . Um {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Mm . Alright .
Marketing: How do you uh uh give input to the menu on the L_C_D_ screen ?
User Interface: {vocalsound} Um with the uh the up and down and and well buttons and the {disfmarker}
Marketing: Alright . So you have a menu button , and then you can go up and down .
Project Manager: But then we should also have an uh an Okay button .
User Interface: Well I will draw what I had drawn on the screen . Yes .
Marketing: Yeah right .
User Interface: {vocalsound} Um I shall draw this . If it uh works .
Industrial Designer: {gap} button , yeah .
Project Manager: Just uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} There is already a blank . Yes ? So {disfmarker} Yeah .
Marketing: Yeah . {vocalsound}
User Interface: Mm so have I .
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
User Interface: Nah .
Marketing: {gap} . {gap} You have to push hard .
Project Manager: {vocalsound} {gap}
Marketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: I suggest a banana shape .
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Yeah .
Industrial Designer: Because of the fruity uh fashion .
Marketing: Yeah .
Project Manager: No m Next year that's out .
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Yellow and {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Yeah alright , yeah . Just a hunch . {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
User Interface: Well these little buttons are a bit difficult to uh draw uh correct .
Project Manager: Yeah .
Industrial Designer: Those are the the cha the channel buttons of course ?
User Interface: Yeah just uh the numbers . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: And then below is the L_C_D_ screen ?
User Interface: These these will be bigger in the the real design .
Industrial Designer: {gap}
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Alright , yeah .
User Interface: This must be the Okay button used to uh interact with the L_C_D_ screen .
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm .
User Interface: And with this you can uh , yes , go to through the menus
Project Manager: Yeah .
User Interface: and that can Um the video button should be uh an apart button ,
Marketing: You've {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Yes .
User Interface: because you want it to uh t , yeah , to use it fast within one uh click .
Marketing: Right .
Project Manager: And what's the menu button ?
User Interface: Um it's {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Marketing: And you you need a you need a speaker .
User Interface: Hmm ?
Marketing: For the {disfmarker} {gap}
User Interface: This button can also be the Menu button , we use in the menus {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: But how did {disfmarker} How do you get out of the menu then ? Yeah .
User Interface: Well we we can add another button here , but {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Maybe I you could j just do an an exit with Okay . Uh {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Uh by pe pressing the menu button again . By pressing the menu button again , you go uh out .
User Interface: Yeah .
Marketing: Yeah . Yeah .
Industrial Designer: It's usual the the the d kind of the way it works .
Project Manager: Yes , well but bec because when you {vocalsound} push Menu you get in ,
Industrial Designer: Yeah ? Yeah ?
Project Manager: and then you have to push Okay when you get to a choice .
User Interface: Ah right . Well you you {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Yeah . But you can men you can press menu again to get out .
Project Manager: Well that's also the Okay button . That's you you should have uh {disfmarker}
User Interface: No no , we we we should uh add uh a extra Menu button
Industrial Designer: No .
Project Manager: Or you can put in the L_C_D_'s uh window an option Get Out .
User Interface: and this the Okay button .
Marketing: Exit .
Project Manager: Exit {gap} .
User Interface: Ah once you have an extra Menu button , you don't need that that extra option .
Project Manager: Well , it's just a choice .
User Interface: You have uh redundancy .
Marketing: But we need a we need a a recording recording button for the speech uh part .
User Interface: Yeah ,
Industrial Designer: {gap}
Marketing: Or don't {disfmarker}
User Interface: if we decide to uh to implement that , maybe we should .
Industrial Designer: Why would you put it uh then , and where is the recording uh the microphone ?
User Interface: Well they that could be anywhere .
Industrial Designer: Where would you put it ?
User Interface: That's very small . It could be uh down here . {vocalsound} Um . Well , not here .
Industrial Designer: Uh-huh .
User Interface: I {vocalsound} yeah I suggest here . But that's just a little {vocalsound} gap . Yeah .
Industrial Designer: Microphone , yeah .
Marketing: Right , and spea speaker at the back , or something .
User Interface: Well the speaker and the microphone , I think , are the same uh little hole thingy .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah I understand .
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah .
Marketing: {vocalsound} Alright .
Industrial Designer: Uh but uh we could uh d do , but it's perhaps more expensive , uh the speaker on the back or something .
User Interface: Well i Um there are a all already being implemented in in coffee machines , so they won't be uh very expensive . But {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Huh ?
Industrial Designer: Alright .
Marketing: Alright .
Project Manager: Yeah ? Okay .
User Interface: This is my suggested design .
Project Manager: Well , okay , alright . Um then let's have a look at the decisions we are going to have to make .
User Interface: Um {disfmarker} Yes . And oh I think as you can see so , the L_C_D_ screen does look better uh at the lower end , or at the bottom .
Project Manager: I'd {disfmarker} I agree .
User Interface: {vocalsound} But {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Marketing: Yeah , fine . {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Fine . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Well yeah yeah yeah .
Marketing: Move on . {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Yeah .
User Interface: Oh , um I had some uh examples .
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: I can live with it .
Project Manager: Yes ?
User Interface: You can uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} But {disfmarker} I did not like it very much , but {disfmarker}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
User Interface: Well these are quite obvious , very ugly remote . {vocalsound} Um {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Too big . {vocalsound}
Marketing: Yeah .
Industrial Designer: They do they don't look fruity enough .
User Interface: No , well th
Marketing: {vocalsound} Nei They're n they're not trendy .
Project Manager: They're all black .
User Interface: Yeah . Well not all . {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Hey , that one I like . {vocalsound}
User Interface: Uh this is for children but {vocalsound} th
Industrial Designer: Tho Yeah those {disfmarker}
Marketing: It doesn't look strong . {vocalsound}
Project Manager: No .
User Interface: {vocalsound} No .
Industrial Designer: But it doesn't uh the {disfmarker}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} The remote . {vocalsound}
User Interface: W but with the colours i it's a bit the way we're going to .
Industrial Designer: Yeah , ok Yeah .
Marketing: Yeah right .
User Interface: Well this is a terrible {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Terrible .
Marketing: This is just crazy .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} But it it must not look too childish of course huh ?
Project Manager: It's it's all too much buttons .
User Interface: Um this looks {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Too many buttons . That's {disfmarker}
User Interface: Yeah . This uh these are the L_C_D_ screens . I think we should , if it's um possible , uh one with colours , but {disfmarker}
Marketing: Nah th It's too expensive .
User Interface: I don't know uh {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Well , that's too expensive I think .
User Interface: Too expensive ? Alright .
Marketing: Yeah .
Project Manager: Alright . Yeah .
User Interface: Well {disfmarker} Nah .
Industrial Designer: But it {disfmarker} Yeah . {gap}
Project Manager: Okay . Huh .
User Interface: Ha , even more . N
Project Manager: Mm no . {vocalsound} 'Kay .
Marketing: But are we going for a strange uh form ?
Project Manager: No , not very strange .
Marketing: 'Cause people like that .
Industrial Designer: Not not too strange . No .
Marketing: Not too strange .
Project Manager: It still has t
Marketing: You can make the the underside , you can make it more round , where the L_C_D_ is .
Project Manager: Yes . Th a a kind of bridge . So it f falls over the hand .
User Interface: Well {disfmarker}
Marketing: I dunno if you know the No Nokia telephone , with uh the round uh thing at at the bottoms , s something like that .

Project Manager: I got this from our friends .
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Uh yeah the conceptual design .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Our sources .
Project Manager: These are a few examples which we have to decide about . All the the materials from the case , uh the electric cable that's all your uh your side of the story . Um {disfmarker}
Marketing: Your bag . {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah . Um now from the user interface , your uh package ? {vocalsound} Um where {disfmarker} No well , that's more like the buttons where they have to come . And um {disfmarker} B a bit of , yeah well , a bit of uh design .
User Interface: Yeah , this is what we've just done . Right ?
Project Manager: Yes , but we have to decide about these now .
Industrial Designer: But uh we should decide now .
User Interface: Ah right .
Marketing: Yeah .
Project Manager: And uh the trend-watching .
Marketing: Materials are the most , most impor
Project Manager: So as you said , fruity is in , well {gap} sells good .
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Wow .
Marketing: Yeah .
Project Manager: Uh these things .

Project Manager: Uh yes . Um so if we uh go through them {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Copy paste uh this story into a into a Word document , and then uh put the answers after the subjects . {vocalsound} Yeah .
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
User Interface: Not everything .
Industrial Designer: Well we have to decide all these things ?
User Interface: Yeah but {vocalsound} all these examples are uh of a coffee machine .
Project Manager: Yeah well uh {disfmarker} Why should I uh {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: W we can uh override them ?
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Yeah .
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: So {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Well a case ? Uh that's me . Uh I suggest {disfmarker} Well what do I suggest actually ? {vocalsound}
Project Manager: What what kind of properties should it have ? Well we just listened .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Uh s solid ,
User Interface: I think we {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: yeah . Yeah .
User Interface: Why don't we um use uh titanium or or a hard , yeah , some kind of metal for the uh the the whole remote except the front .
Marketing: Do you know the new uh {disfmarker}
User Interface: That {disfmarker} Just like um most cell phones are .
Industrial Designer: Yeah , I understand .
Marketing: No {vocalsound} no {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah . So we have titanium . {vocalsound}
Marketing: The front is the most important .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah but the non-removable elements of the of the remote , so not the front , could be titanium ,
User Interface: Yeah .
Industrial Designer: to give that uh strong look .
Project Manager: You know what ?
Industrial Designer: And then the front is made of plastic . And you can put that on and off , and switch it .
User Interface: Yeah .
Marketing: But the feel of plastic isn't strong . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: No but you have titanium of course .
User Interface: No but you you have this {disfmarker} Yeah .
Industrial Designer: Uh you have the best of both worlds .
Marketing: Yeah alright , alright . 'Kay .
User Interface: Yeah , you have the re remote in your hand like this . So you feel titanium . {gap}
Industrial Designer: And of course , yeah , you have the the the plastic front end . But you also have the titanium .
Marketing: Yeah . {vocalsound} Fronts are are cheaper than when they're from plas
User Interface: Yeah .
Industrial Designer: Yeah of course , but yeah {vocalsound} you have to make a decision .
User Interface: And I don't know if you can make steel just any way you want it to .

Industrial Designer: I guess so .
User Interface: Yeah .
Industrial Designer: Uh titanium I sh I think uh {disfmarker}
Marketing: Bendable .
Industrial Designer: Huh ? Well , well the {disfmarker}
Marketing: {vocalsound} Bendable .
User Interface: Well any colour {gap} {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: According to my sources , uh it's it's totally possible to make an entire uh uh uh {disfmarker} Titanium is available , and uh we can uh make uh an entire remote out of it , if we want .
User Interface: Yeah , then you you paint it in the colour you want it . The plastic is is the colour you want it .
Industrial Designer: Mm .
Marketing: Yeah . Paint spray .
Industrial Designer: Mm .
Marketing: Yeah alright .
User Interface: So {gap} {disfmarker} Yeah .
Project Manager: Alright .
Marketing: So , we're going for a titanium back and a plastic front ?
Project Manager: I've uh {disfmarker}
User Interface: Mm .
Industrial Designer: Yeah ,
Project Manager: Titanium back , plastic front .
Industrial Designer: I think that's a nice trade-off .
Project Manager: Okay . Um well I am going to put it in here , uh because we can uh look .
Marketing: Yeah , great .
Project Manager: I {disfmarker} Um solid feel and trendy look .
User Interface: Yeah .
Industrial Designer: Alright .

Industrial Designer: Yeah , for the front and then titanium for the back .
Marketing: Yeah .
Industrial Designer: For the non-removable uh part .
Marketing: But then you have the problem , when you have a titanium back , you can't switch it . When you want an other colour on the front , it doesn't match .
User Interface: Well titanium is neutral . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Well but {disfmarker} {vocalsound}

Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: So {vocalsound} what are we going to do ? {vocalsound} I as Project Manager ha don't have a clue . {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound} Let's start the design .
Project Manager: Oh we can uh decide how we implement {vocalsound} the feeling from our company into the remote .
User Interface: Mm .
Industrial Designer: Well yeah . Um I think um {vocalsound} a logo , our company logo , and the slogan should be or could be {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Also the slogan ? On the {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Yeah , why not ? {vocalsound} If there's enough space , {vocalsound} you can put uh {disfmarker}
User Interface: Uh I I'd say only the logo .
Industrial Designer: We'll we'll {disfmarker}
Marketing: O Yeah . Me too .
User Interface: Too much text and it gets too too busy .
Industrial Designer: Well , our slogan is not very long . It's just a simple {disfmarker}
Project Manager: We put the fashion in electronics .
User Interface: Well {vocalsound} it's quite a long phrase .
Industrial Designer: What is it ? {vocalsound}
Project Manager: We put the fashion in electronics .
Marketing: But we kree we keep adjusting to the fashion with our fronts . So {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} You c {vocalsound} But you can put it on the back , on the titanium part . The logo and the and the {disfmarker}
User Interface: Ah the logo should be on the top I think .
Marketing: Yeah , right . The logo {disfmarker}
Project Manager: On the top . Yeah . Well in in in the right top corner ?
Industrial Designer: Yeah they do . Well yeah .
Marketing: Yeah .
User Interface: Right corner , yes .

User Interface: {gap} uh the text ?
Project Manager: Yeah .
User Interface: Yeah .
Project Manager: Just just small .
User Interface: Uh yeah , at the back ?
Marketing: But the logo the logo shouldn't be exchangeable , when you get off the front .
User Interface: Well you c Well uh {disfmarker} Yes .

Project Manager: Yeah well {disfmarker}
Marketing: Yeah . {vocalsound} Yeah .
User Interface: You can {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: and you can remove the front .
User Interface: The logo can be on on every uh front .

Industrial Designer: but on the backside . Uh {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Sorry .

User Interface: Yeah .
Marketing: I agree .
Industrial Designer: To make more uh of an impression .
Marketing: But not too big .

Project Manager: and logo also on the front but not exchange uh {disfmarker} Uh ? Hmm ? {vocalsound} {gap} Uh when changing fronts .
Marketing: {vocalsound} {gap} {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Alright , that's decided .
