Project Manager: Mm .
Marketing: So ,
Project Manager: So , uh now {vocalsound}
Marketing: Hi Christa . {vocalsound}
Project Manager: it's the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Hi Sammy . {vocalsound} It's the detail design meeting , so we're going {disfmarker} last meeting . So um , first uh Mark and Rama are going to present uh the prototype . Uh then uh Sammy will propose some uh crite cr criteria to evaluate this prototype . Then , w we {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yes . {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound} Yes . {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} And then we going to do some finance to see if uh it is uh feasible
User Interface: And chocolate ? {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} and uh at the end we will we will um evaluate ourself as a team . {vocalsound} And that's all . Okay . So first , {vocalsound} let's uh see the prototype .
Marketing: Mm .
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Uh , here we have our prototype model .
Project Manager: Okay . And you have some slides then ?
User Interface: Mm-hmm .
Industrial Designer: Yeah . Yeah , we have also some slides .
Project Manager: {gap} Yeah . Mm .
User Interface: Yes , and place some slides .
Project Manager: Okay . Uh so in which uh {disfmarker}
User Interface: Uh , participant three . {vocalsound} Prototype .
Industrial Designer: In {disfmarker} Yeah .
Project Manager: Mm okay . Mm .
Industrial Designer: Five .
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound} Uh , so this is our remote control .
Industrial Designer: Him .
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
User Interface: It's a r working prototype . You can use it now by switching all these buttons . So first , I present as we came to this perfect model ,
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
User Interface: and then we'll give some technical specifications .
Marketing: Yeah .
Project Manager: Mm-hmm .
User Interface: That's {vocalsound} well {vocalsound} {vocalsound} , so that's that . Please , next slide . We analysed all the fruits
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
User Interface: and contacted NASA , and uh made some {vocalsound} real good {disfmarker}
Project Manager: MASA ? {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound}
User Interface: Yeah . If you can see this , and the stars are showing that {gap} . And um , {vocalsound} s society will accept that . For sure .
Marketing: Mm-hmm .
User Interface: {vocalsound} And making some analysis of different fruits , we choose the ultimate form , ultimate colours , and uh ultimate smell of it . S please , next slide . But we still didn't want to go far from our titanium idea , 'cause it's the most of the moder the m the {gap} modern material we can p select . And it's practical . And it's still say it's for our needs , so please press something . And as I said , {vocalsound} it's perfect . {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Okay . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound} Please press it .
Industrial Designer: Experience . Explanat
User Interface: Everyone is {gap} f really uh really glad to obtain an {disfmarker} {vocalsound} s such a r such a device .
Marketing: Such a nice thing . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: See this {gap} . {vocalsound}
User Interface: So you can touch it with your hands .
Marketing: Can I ?
User Interface: Sure . Yes . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: You can {disfmarker}
Marketing: Ho-ho . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} imitating flatulence] {vocalsound}
Project Manager: What do you say ? {vocalsound}
User Interface: N
Marketing: It says {vocalsound} {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound} You must say it .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Spongy .
Marketing: I will uh {disfmarker}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} One day .
Marketing: I'll buy it . {vocalsound}
User Interface: Yeah . {vocalsound}
Marketing: If I if I need so . {vocalsound}
Project Manager: He {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound}
Marketing: Hopefully my daughter will like it . {vocalsound}
User Interface: Okay . Y and we got the answer . Uh , it is , yes , of course .
Marketing: Yes , of course . Of c course . {vocalsound}
User Interface: {gap} , please next slide . Um , this is a prototype . You can have a look at it , and {disfmarker} That's all I wanted to say .
Marketing: Ah .
User Interface: Now it's technical specification by our colleague .
Industrial Designer: Hmm .
Project Manager: Hmm .
Industrial Designer: So {disfmarker}
Marketing: Oh , there is {vocalsound} a button missing .
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
Marketing: {vocalsound} Okay . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: This this is really flexible . You can add your buttons .
Marketing: It's in option . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah . So function , mm {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Mm-hmm .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} So , as we discussed , we have to switch on switch off whenever we want . And so , we have buttons and using L_C_D_ , or like you can use this {vocalsound} jog wheel and select which ever option on the L_C_D_ , and then do on and off . {vocalsound} Then you ha you'll have volume control . So , you you can press these buttons to increase or decrease the volume .
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: And we have some L_C_D_ controls . Like , m switching the L_C_D_ display if you want to use L_C_D_ , or you don't want you can just use normal button .
Project Manager: Mm-hmm .
Industrial Designer: And we have speech recognition . Here you have microphone , and then it date records your voice , and then it try to recognise .
Marketing: Hmm .
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: And it can also do the action .
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: And location finder . And we want to do the location basically using speech recogniser . You can just say , where is my remote control .
Marketing: Mm-hmm .
Industrial Designer: Or uh , you can just give some nickname to your remote control , like Bobby {gap} .
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Bobby . {vocalsound} Mm-hmm .
Marketing: {vocalsound} Hey , babe .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} And then , {vocalsound} it will say hi . {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound} Bob . {vocalsound} Hey Bob . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah , hi , and then you can use it . {vocalsound}
Marketing: Okay ,
Project Manager: Hmm . {vocalsound} 'Kay . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound}
Marketing: that's good .
Industrial Designer: So , {vocalsound} um our team is now fruits . Mainly strawberry . So , you can {vocalsound} have {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound} Oh , these are strawberries . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: And then you can see the look L_C_D_ and all the switches .
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Are colourful . Yeah . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Material , we want to stick to titanium . {vocalsound} We will send , we want to {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound} Fruit smelling spongy titanium . {vocalsound} I didn't know it exist , but that's great .
Industrial Designer: Yeah , or s {vocalsound} So , we want to have {vocalsound} simple and perfect shapes , like I shown in these phones . You can have your own designs and and you can feel simple designs . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} And you can choose colours on your day for each day , or even many colours .
Marketing: Ha .
Project Manager: Ho-ho . That's for the L_C_D_ or for the titanium ?
Marketing: You mean we can change the colour uh of th
Industrial Designer: For the L_C_D_ .
Marketing: Yeah . Yeah okay , for the L_C_D_ .
Industrial Designer: With titanium it's {disfmarker} it is silver .
Marketing: Tit titanium is {disfmarker}
User Interface: We are still working on titanium .
Project Manager: Mm-mm .
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
User Interface: So , r we'll start with L_C_D_ .
Marketing: Uh , okay .
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Mm , yeah . {vocalsound}
User Interface: You can ask Bob . It's Tuesday . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Hey , you know you're theme today . {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah , Bob , please . {vocalsound} {gap} Tuesday colour . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Yeah . Even you can configure your colours for its {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} depending on your mood , or s
Marketing: Okay .
Project Manager: Hmm .
Marketing: Mm-hmm .
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound} Black for Sunday . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} And you can have many colours on weekends . Or {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Project Manager: And w wait , wh what are the strawberries for ? {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Wh wh
Industrial Designer: Huh ?
Marketing: On the L_C_D_ ?
Industrial Designer: Ah , these are like sensors .
Marketing: Oh .
Project Manager: Mm-hmm . {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound} Of course .
User Interface: That's location sensors .
Marketing: {vocalsound} What do you think ? {vocalsound} Strawberry sensors . {vocalsound} Very useful .
Project Manager: Okay . {vocalsound} Strawberries .
Industrial Designer: So , {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: after this meeting we'll propose a party for our success for {disfmarker}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Ah . {vocalsound}
Marketing: Lounge meeting . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} So , if you are vegetarian or you have any options , please let us know .
Marketing: {vocalsound}
User Interface: Yeah , and we can just {gap} some strawberry first . Um {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Okay . {vocalsound} Mm-hmm . {vocalsound}
Marketing: Alright . Good . {vocalsound}
User Interface: Oops .
Industrial Designer: S
Marketing: So , huh . Interesting . In interesting . Mm mm .
Project Manager: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: So , any specific questions for {disfmarker}
Project Manager: we'll see in the financial part if uh {vocalsound} all {vocalsound} {gap} {vocalsound} gets into {disfmarker}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound} It makes sense .
Industrial Designer: Yeah . {vocalsound}
User Interface: Let's make a party first maybe . {vocalsound} {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} W Who is the five uh {disfmarker} fifty millions we {vocalsound} first make a party in ?
Industrial Designer: Yeah . Then we can discuss {disfmarker} We can {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah , then we can have how much for how money is left . {vocalsound}
Marketing: So uh , this is {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Mm-hmm .
Marketing: What a design .
Project Manager: Okay . {vocalsound} Uh , so {disfmarker} Let's uh ,
Marketing: {vocalsound} It's my turn .
Project Manager: yeah , let's see if uh th it's meet the evaluation criterium . {vocalsound}
Marketing: Mm-hmm . Let's see if this {disfmarker} Yeah , if you meet {vocalsound} the evaluation criterion .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Oops .
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Fudge .
Marketing: Yeah . So , evaluation please . So . You made a very nice prototype , and um , I think , we now need altogether to try to evaluate it to see if it makes sense to do it , if it fulfils our {disfmarker} what we want to do , and things like that . So mm {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Uh , next slide , please . {vocalsound} As you know , before going and uh creating and producing these strawberry {vocalsound} uh {vocalsound} remote control , it's very important to first verify if it makes sense , if we have a chance to sell it .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah .
Marketing: Uh , so we need to evaluate it um , try to do it in a constative way , and as much as we can . To {disfmarker} so what I propose is that we are going to to have this scale from one to seven . One meaning that , ye yes uh it fulfils uh the the criterion , whatever it is . And seven meaning , no it doesn't fulfil at all . And we're all l going to list all the criterion . I'm going to go to that next slide ,
Project Manager: Okay .
Marketing: and together try to evaluate this according to this criterion and from one to seven . And then we are just going to have an average , which will give us the value of our uh remote control . So , maybe we can have a look at the criteria ?
Industrial Designer: Fancy .
Marketing: So these are the criterion uh I'm {disfmarker} I thought were important . Of course , this can be discussed , but let's let's see , so let's vote . So we have fancy here and we have the scale from one to seven with four in the middle .
Project Manager: Mm-hmm .
Industrial Designer: Huh .
Marketing: So ,
Industrial Designer: Yeah , what's is really {disfmarker}
Marketing: what do you think , is it fancy ? {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Uh , it's really {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Uh , I think that fancy , we can say it is fancy . {vocalsound} {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound} It is very very fancy . Or have you ever seen something like that ? {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Oh . I am not the d the only one choosing , yeah .
Marketing: Yeah , of course .
Project Manager: Uh what do you think ?
Marketing: What do you think ?
User Interface: Feel the weight .
Marketing: Is it {disfmarker} The weight is later .
Industrial Designer: Yeah . Oh .
User Interface: Really . {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Uh-huh . {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound} Now {vocalsound} we're {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
User Interface: Okay .
Marketing: We're on the fanciness now . I think it's quite fancy .
Industrial Designer: Yeah , yeah .
Project Manager: Yeah . Yeah .
Industrial Designer: We can give at least five or six , seven .
Marketing: It's uh {disfmarker} Yeah , so {disfmarker} No it's it's one .
Project Manager: It's in the other {gap} .
Industrial Designer: Oh , {gap} Oh . So {disfmarker} Oh , okay . Yeah , okay . Oh , okay . So {disfmarker}
Marketing: Yeah , o one means it's , yes , a very fancy and seven mean no at all .
Project Manager: Mm . {vocalsound}
Marketing: So it's one or two .
Project Manager: Two . Let's say two , yeah .
Industrial Designer: M maybe two .
Marketing: What do you think ? Two ?
User Interface: Two . Two .
Marketing: Okay . So here , two . Up .
Industrial Designer: Technology .
Marketing: Then we have uh technology .
Industrial Designer: Yeah . Um {disfmarker}
Marketing: So , what about technology ? We have uh we have speech recognition , we have location based {gap} ,
Industrial Designer: And we have L_C_D_ .
Marketing: we have L_C_D_ .
Project Manager: Change colour of t
Industrial Designer: So you change colours .
Marketing: Change colour , I mean that's very {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Useful .
Project Manager: Yeah , I think it's a {disfmarker}
Marketing: Quite
User Interface: Yeah , yeah , yeah .
Marketing: d I think it's a one for that , at least .
Project Manager: Yeah . Yeah .
User Interface: Yeah . Uh {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Yeah , yeah . It's silly .
Marketing: At least a one , yeah .
Project Manager: Mm-mm . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound}
Marketing: Robustness , uh-huh .
Industrial Designer: Uh , still we need to cha {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound} So {vocalsound} let's suppose my daughter take it and um {vocalsound} {disfmarker} and through it away .
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Um {disfmarker}
Marketing: Do you think it makes sense that it's going to live again ? Uh , maybe not the prototype .
Project Manager: The strawberries {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Yeah , it {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Oh . {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound} Let's try . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Oh my god . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Maybe strawberry .
Marketing: Okay , we just lost one strawberry .
User Interface: No .
Industrial Designer: Oh .
Marketing: So {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
User Interface: No . How can I say this .
Marketing: Not at all ?
Industrial Designer: Yeah , we can easily plug it .
User Interface: It's still it's still working , and your daughter got a bonus .
Marketing: It is {disfmarker} Yeah . {vocalsound} Yeah .
User Interface: {vocalsound} A strawberry .
Marketing: So it's not so bad .
Project Manager: Mm-mm .
Industrial Designer: Yeah , yeah .
Marketing: I um uh I would say three .
Project Manager: Yeah . But it's too {gap} .
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
Project Manager: It's um robust , yeah .
Marketing: Yeah , that does make sense , yeah ?
Industrial Designer: Useful ?
Marketing: Useful . {vocalsound} Well , so the question is does it have uh the minimum requirement of re remote control ?
Industrial Designer: Yeah , {gap} {disfmarker}
Marketing: So I don't know . These buttons are uh {disfmarker} It not clear .
Project Manager: Oh , yeah , lets me try .
Marketing: But you have at least uh next produce .
Project Manager: Yeah .
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
Project Manager: What is uh next , please ?
Industrial Designer: Yeah , channel . I this is volume control and channel changes . These are the main {disfmarker}
Marketing: Uh , it depends on the {disfmarker}
Project Manager: And you can uh do di two sites ?
Marketing: Okay .
Industrial Designer: You {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Yeah .
Industrial Designer: Yeah . Yeah , and you can do on L_C_D_ using these going to scrolling all the option .
Project Manager: Okay , also .
Industrial Designer: So if you don't want {disfmarker}
Marketing: So but , for instance , because the L_C_D_ is not uh touch control , touch screen , you cannot go to channel twenty five directly .
Industrial Designer: Yeah , um {disfmarker} yeah .
Project Manager: You can , by using the {disfmarker}
User Interface: You can .
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
Marketing: Directly .
User Interface: You go {disfmarker} you {disfmarker}
Project Manager: You c push here the the {disfmarker}
User Interface: So , the basic mode {disfmarker}
Project Manager: yeah . {vocalsound}
User Interface: Yeah . So that's simple . The basic mode is uh you got just two buttons and a jog dial .
Marketing: Yeah .
User Interface: With two buttons , you do this like uh volume up , volume down .
Marketing: Oh , it's a jog dial , okay .
User Interface: Or if you go to the site , it's channel up channel down .
Industrial Designer: And channel .
Marketing: Uh-huh . Okay .
User Interface: And if you want to make to s twenty-five , you push on this .
Marketing: Yeah .
User Interface: You select twenty , you select five .
Industrial Designer: You can select .
Marketing: {vocalsound} Okay .
User Interface: That's it .
Industrial Designer: Yeah mm .
Marketing: It's much longer than that that being two two five , no ?
User Interface: No .
Marketing: Don't you think so ? May {disfmarker} not {disfmarker} okay , we can go . That's uh {disfmarker} You're right .
Industrial Designer: Yeah , yeah , yeah . Y you need to like press two and five and {disfmarker} Yeah .
Marketing: That's {disfmarker} it's less uh {disfmarker} Yeah . But it's it's nice , because people anyway don't go there .
Industrial Designer: Yeah , yeah . Yeah mm .
Marketing: But {disfmarker} {vocalsound} So what do you think for it , usefulness ?
Industrial Designer: So , d Yeah , we need to address {disfmarker} we want {disfmarker}
Marketing: Seems to be useful . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: we only address two main functions here and the other functions will be on L_C_D_ . So
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Let me understand well ,
Industrial Designer: so {disfmarker}
Project Manager: because I'm not sure {disfmarker} that's for {disfmarker} that this one are b d uh two dir directional button .
Marketing: Both . Yeah . Yeah .
User Interface: Yeah . Yeah .
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
Project Manager: Yeah .
Industrial Designer: Yeah . Up .
Marketing: Up down or left right . Yeah .
Project Manager: Yeah . And which {disfmarker} what is that ?
User Interface: It's a jog dial for controlling the cursor on the L_C_D_ screen .
Industrial Designer: This is jog wheel .
Marketing: That {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Okay , okay . It's a kind {disfmarker} Oh , okay okay . {vocalsound}
User Interface: Like , selecting the menus .
Industrial Designer: Yeah . Um , {vocalsound} see in L_C_D_ , like you will have blocks and you select which one .
Marketing: Cool .
Project Manager: Oh oh okay , great .
Marketing: I would say then uh {disfmarker} {gap}
Project Manager: Now it's looks us useful .
Industrial Designer: Yeah . Yeah .
Marketing: Two or three ?
Project Manager: Yeah .
Marketing: Two or three ?
Industrial Designer: Two , maybe . {vocalsound}
Marketing: Two .
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah .
Marketing: Okay , two . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} So size and weight .
Industrial Designer: Yeah , yeah . {gap}
Marketing: Is it the the the effective size and weight that the {disfmarker} Is it uh real size , real weight ? Or {disfmarker} Because it {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Yeah , it's {disfmarker} size al almost {gap} {disfmarker}
Marketing: Size is going to be that , yeah ?
Industrial Designer: Yeah , because it is {disfmarker}
Marketing: Uh , and and {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: The weight will be bit lighter . We will s We use titanium .
User Interface: Sure ,
Project Manager: Mm-mm .
User Interface: without titanium alloy , it's going to be light .
Industrial Designer: Yeah . Yeah . Yeah .
Marketing: It's going to be lighter ,
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
User Interface: Of course .
Marketing: because this seems to be very heavy f I mean ,
Industrial Designer: Heavy . Yeah .
Marketing: for my daughter , for instance .
Project Manager: Mm-hmm . {vocalsound} {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
Marketing: {vocalsound} Not sure if uh {vocalsound} she can use it . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: But sides {disfmarker} uh , the sides should be okay . {gap} . Yeah
Marketing: So , should be okay .
Industrial Designer: mm .
Marketing: Up to three for that ,
Project Manager: Mm-mm .
Marketing: because I'm {disfmarker} haven't seen the weight so I must not uh {disfmarker}
User Interface: Okay . Okay .
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Oh .
Marketing: Colour and shape .
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Uh-oh . {vocalsound}
Marketing: Well , so colour , it seems that we have the several colours for the L_C_D_ .
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
Project Manager: Yeah .
Marketing: But um , it's not very clear what is the colour of the sh the sh {vocalsound} the case .
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah .
Industrial Designer: The case is silver titanium , no ?
Marketing: It's a {disfmarker} it's going to be titanium . Okay , okay .
Project Manager: Yeah , it's {gap} .
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
Marketing: That's nice .
Project Manager: Let's imagine .
Marketing: {vocalsound} I think it's good . Okay .
Project Manager: {vocalsound} And what about the strawberries on the top ? {vocalsound} I'm not convince . {vocalsound} But maybe I'm not trendy . But , uh {disfmarker}
Marketing: Yahoo . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Well y you know , it's this uh fruit and vegetable year .
Industrial Designer: Oh . Yeah , yeah . Yeah .
Project Manager: Yeah , but uh {vocalsound} uh they're not useful .
Marketing: So {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Project Manager: I I mean it {disfmarker} that's uh {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} So maybe , I think {disfmarker}
Marketing: Uh , I think usefulness is m as as I rem um just have to remind you that usefulness is much less important than fanciness .
Project Manager: Mm-hmm .
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
Project Manager: Yep .
Industrial Designer: Yeah , well {disfmarker}
Marketing: Whether it's fancy or not now , it {disfmarker} we have to decide .
Project Manager: Hmm .
Industrial Designer: Yeah . Um {disfmarker}
Marketing: But this
Project Manager: I would have m uh i found more fancy that the fruits are useful .
Marketing: If it's {disfmarker} Uh-huh . So , that they will {disfmarker} that maybe the fruit may be here instead . {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Yeah .
Industrial Designer: Yeah , well then it's bit difficult to use . Not like this d We're just giving the fruit for more fanciness and more attraction , too .
Project Manager: Mm-hmm . But the n {vocalsound} Yeah .
Industrial Designer: So , maybe think we can have rubber or some sponges , stuff for strawberries and different colours .
Project Manager: Mm .
Industrial Designer: So it's {disfmarker}
Marketing: So , it seems we are not so clear on the shape uh {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Even {disfmarker}
Project Manager: No , I'm not sure uh why {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: These buttons {disfmarker}
Project Manager: uh if it was like this {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: {gap} But it looks really {vocalsound} not really good .
Project Manager: I It's {gap} n {vocalsound} no , it's not fancy any more .
Industrial Designer: I mean , the f Yeah . So these are kind of rubber things . Even if you lose one you can just put whatever .
Project Manager: Okay .
User Interface: And {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Even we can provide many different colours or different fruits , and {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Uh-huh . And different routes . Okay , I see what {disfmarker}
User Interface: Moreover , moreover it covers it covers all the end goals . Even if it is , you know , it's very rounded ,
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
User Interface: but still you got some rubber fruit here , and it's completely uh completely secure to leave it uh with children and that .
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
Project Manager: Okay , so you you you feel like it's something uh a protection for the remote control .
Industrial Designer: Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah , we've {disfmarker} yeah we have sensors here and so here and here ,
Project Manager: Also .
Industrial Designer: so we just {disfmarker} Yeah , so even if you don't put , it works . But this is really fancy . {gap}
Project Manager: Okay .
Marketing: I suggested three .
Project Manager: Okay . {vocalsound}
Marketing: Because uh , everybody s doesn't seem to be convince ,
User Interface: Okay . Okay .
Marketing: although it's quite {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
Marketing: You have good arguments .
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
Marketing: But {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Okay . {vocalsound} {vocalsound}
Marketing: And uh the last one is adaptive . This is not r maybe not as important as the other one , {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
Marketing: but uh can we adapt it to each each personal use ?
User Interface: Sure , sure , just look at it . {vocalsound} It's full adaptable . {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound} Great .
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Wow , that's a {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound} Fully adaptable .
User Interface: Yeah , you can fit it into your palm , you know .
Marketing: That's {disfmarker} Yeah . {vocalsound} So you can fit into your palm , okay .
Project Manager: Yea
Industrial Designer: Yeah . {vocalsound}
Marketing: That {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: You can {disfmarker}
Marketing: What else can we need ?
Industrial Designer: Yeah . {vocalsound}
Marketing: You {disfmarker} Do you think you are gonna be able to do that with ti titanium as well ?
Project Manager: Yeah , it's fudge titanium . {vocalsound} You know .
Marketing: {vocalsound} It's fudge , yeah , yeah .
