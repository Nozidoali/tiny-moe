Project Manager: Okay , so now we are on the conceptual design meeting . {vocalsound} Uh y getting close to the last
Marketing: Mm-hmm .
Project Manager: is the penultim meeting . {vocalsound} {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
User Interface: How was lunch ? {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Mm great . {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound} Thanks {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound}
Marketing: Don't be sarcastic . {vocalsound} Mark . {vocalsound}
Project Manager: So {vocalsound} um I will again do the secretary part uh we will have three presentation first um uh the industrial design , first Rama then Mark and then Sammy .
Marketing: Uh Rama .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Ramaro .
Project Manager: Um um we have to take a decision on the control {disfmarker} remote control concepts and we have forty minutes .
User Interface: Mm .
Project Manager: So what we want to {disfmarker} the decision we want to take on this meeting are on the um first on the component concept , so what kind of energy we use uh what kind of chip on print and one ki kind of case . And also on user interface concept uh what kind of interface we use and if there is some supplements . And at the end um Sammy will give um {vocalsound} a trend watching on what he's {disfmarker} he's been doing . It's {disfmarker} So , let's go . First with Rama . Participant two .
Industrial Designer: Yeah , participant two . Component .
Project Manager: Mm-hmm . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Yep . So we're to mainly design f mainly need to know which components we'll use for energy , and the material and interface . For energy there are maybe two or three possibilities . First one , we can use simple battery , or we can use {vocalsound} traditional solar cells or {disfmarker} mm and the material we can have plastic , rubber which is good for this R_S_A_
Marketing: Ah .
Industrial Designer: and then uh titanium , which can be {disfmarker} which have very good look an and then interface we're to use push buttons or liquid crystal d L_C_D_ display . And we can use some {gap} , moving {gap} kind of thing . So , as we discussed before , we need to {disfmarker} we would like to have some speech recognition s chip in our remote control . So this can be simple kind of programmable chip and {disfmarker} which can use microphone {gap} sensors . And we also want to look at our remote control , so . Still we are looking for possible uh technical uh specifications and how w easy we can do and within our pri range , like we're to {disfmarker} in our twelve Euros or around that . So we are looking for simple devices or simple technology to do the location of remote control in a room or in a house .
Project Manager: Mm-hmm , okay .
Industrial Designer: So uh we discussed an {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Excuse me . So we would like to propose battery instead of solar cells and it would be problematic uh to have enough energy with the solar cells
Marketing: Mm-hmm .
Industrial Designer: and so we would like to just use simple battery . And also we want to go for titanium design instead of rubber or {disfmarker} and well the problem is with this design we found that we can't use double-curved shapes .
Marketing: What is a double-curved shape ?
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Like you can have two curves .
Marketing: Uh-huh .
User Interface: Why ?
Industrial Designer: Uh it's {disfmarker} I think in manufacturing I guess it's problematic . So , we want to go for simple push buttons because it need a simple chip and it's really lesser {disfmarker} uh re really less expensive compared to L_C_D_
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: which are uh which needs advanced chip technology and it's more expensive ,
User Interface: Mm-hmm .
Industrial Designer: since we want to put some other features such as speech recognition
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: we want to reduce uh cost .
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Um I want to know why it b uh just uh sorry but for the point before uh why not the rubber , if it is something that it seems to be light .
Marketing: The cost .
Industrial Designer: Uh {disfmarker} Uh {disfmarker} And also like in {disfmarker} if you put a {gap} it's be difficult to do all the moulding of buttons and these things
Project Manager: Okay . You m titanium it's more uh {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: and {disfmarker} Yeah .
User Interface: W we can use something like you know {vocalsound} the whole body's titanium but there are some rubber or I dunno some rubber parts like
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
Marketing: Mm like this ?
Project Manager: Yes so mm {disfmarker}
User Interface: to make it feel better and to you know {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Like in cell phones recently
Project Manager: Uh-huh .
User Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah . Yeah .
Industrial Designer: these {disfmarker} you can {gap} with the rubber in four directions and {disfmarker}
Marketing: Mm-hmm .
Project Manager: Okay . {gap}
Industrial Designer: yeah . But full assembly {disfmarker} We'll use mainly for titanium {gap}
Project Manager: Okay .
Industrial Designer: rubber is expensive
Project Manager: Okay .
Industrial Designer: and also it's bit difficult to do all the shapes uh .
Project Manager: Okay .
Industrial Designer: And this push buttons
Project Manager: Uh yeah so
Industrial Designer: {disfmarker} we we would like to use push buttons instead of L_C_D_s and so we want to mo I mean we're {gap} we want to put speech recognition so we want to reduce price on this technology and so that we can have enough space or enough money
Project Manager: Okay , s so simple button and uh speech recognition for the more complicated .
Industrial Designer: for {disfmarker} S S
Marketing: Speech {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Y yeah we have simple buttons and speech recognition technology ,
User Interface: Mm-hmm .
Project Manager: Okay .
User Interface: Okay , and still we have {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: so {disfmarker}
User Interface: mm can we still include the L_ L_S_D_ display ?
Marketing: L_C_D_ .
User Interface: L_C_D_ yeah L_C_D_ .
Industrial Designer: Uh l
Marketing: Seems not , it's either L_C_D_ or push-button .
Industrial Designer: So uh
User Interface: No ,
Industrial Designer: it's like a {disfmarker}
User Interface: it's not gonna be a t no touchable but still like a source of information or source for menus .
Marketing: Ah .
Industrial Designer: Yeah maybe maybe we can see depending on how we'll come up with our full design then if we have enough money or like for and {disfmarker}
User Interface: Okay , so let's try it , let's t
Industrial Designer: because the speech recognition technology will take at least five Euros or {gap} or something so we want to reduce the cost on display
Marketing: {gap} The L_C_D_ would {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: or this inter
Marketing: The display would only be display and not uh touch sensitive you mean .
User Interface: Yeah , yeah , it's it's not gonna be a touch pad , uh just a display for giving you information .
Marketing: Just uh for output , yeah .
Industrial Designer: Ok Yeah , that can we we can consider ,
Marketing: Yeah .
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Mm-hmm .
Industrial Designer: because like it won't take much money I guess ,
User Interface: Mm-hmm .
Industrial Designer: because {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Okay .
Industrial Designer: Okay , yep .
Project Manager: {gap} Mm .
Industrial Designer: You have any further questions or ?
Marketing: I guess no um . So the batteries uh are going to be very light .
Industrial Designer: Yeah . Yeah , we're to go for li and now I think we have many options in the market so we can go for small nickel or alkaline batteries
Marketing: Okay .
User Interface: Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .
Industrial Designer: for really light batteries and with uh good price .
Marketing: So this device on n that can be used for speech recognition could also be used for just uh the finding it basically , instead of clapping why not just be {disfmarker} ask .
Industrial Designer: Yeah , that's {disfmarker} then the the one thing we want to know is like because remote control is used for like in the household so it it it will be it {disfmarker} m maybe at least five , six people want to use it so so how to uh uh how to define our re speech recognition
Marketing: Mm-hmm .
Industrial Designer: whether we want to do s speaker independent or speaker dependent . If we're going for more speaker independent then it would be like again cumbersome and we need really m more technology
Project Manager: Okay ,
Industrial Designer: and so {disfmarker}
Project Manager: for the location . Hmm .
Industrial Designer: Yeah , if if everybody in the house n {gap} to locate then we're to go for some speaker independent technology or something .
Marketing: Okay . {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Okay . So let's now go to the {disfmarker} you don't have more question ?
Industrial Designer: {gap}
Marketing: No , it's okay .
Project Manager: Um mm thank you mm .
User Interface: No more questions .
Industrial Designer: Yep . Thank you .
Marketing: Puts less of constraint on what we can do
Project Manager: Yeah .
User Interface: Mm yeah , yeah .
Marketing: but
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
Marketing: it's always like that . We have dreams and the {disfmarker} in the end we find out that it's not feasible . {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Yeah , but {disfmarker} mm .
Industrial Designer: Oh . We have uh some limitations {gap} . {vocalsound}
Marketing: Anyway . {vocalsound} Yeah .
User Interface: But still uh L_S_D_'s already quite nice ,
Marketing: L_C_D_ .
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Okay . {vocalsound}
User Interface: L_C_ {vocalsound}
Marketing: L_S_D_ is something else ,
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}
Marketing: and it's quite nice as well . {vocalsound}
User Interface: I'm an artist , sorry . {vocalsound}
Marketing: So ,
Project Manager: Um {vocalsound} yeah .
User Interface: So uh , that's not {disfmarker}
Marketing: go on uh artist . {vocalsound}
User Interface: I hope that's not too much .
Project Manager: Now let's talk about uh interface .
User Interface: Okay . {vocalsound} Uh participant number three .
Project Manager: Three .
Industrial Designer: Three .
User Interface: {vocalsound} Uh
Project Manager: Which one ? {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Hmm . {vocalsound}
User Interface: mm mm uh have a look at this {disfmarker}
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: no it's {disfmarker} yeah .
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Okay .
User Interface: {gap} Uh so the concept of the interface . Generally I developed quite a broad concept not only for the interface , but for possible instruction or user's manual and uh all the complex things that come together with your T_V_ and remote controls . So let's start with this . We got our perfect remote control with a lot of buttons
Marketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound}
User Interface: and uh we got explanation for every button
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: and you can use your time and uh it will take i some days to learn all this buttons and um the L_C_D_ is going to be somewhere here and uh go back button , I don't know really where it is , maybe one of this buttons , and um power on and off mm I I don't remember
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Mm .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
User Interface: so uh it it it should be maybe this button is power on and off ? Or no {gap} ? I can see nothing . So that's our concept . It's called the millennium remote control .
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Let's change millenniums . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} So
User Interface: Yeah .
Industrial Designer: maybe you can use {gap} in the end and {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Marketing: {gap} doesn't make sense . This is very {vocalsound} ugly .
User Interface: Really ? {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
User Interface: I thought you like it . Ah okay
Marketing: Oh no ,
User Interface: just press the button , please uh . {vocalsound}
Marketing: too much concept .
Project Manager: No .
Marketing: Ah .
Industrial Designer: Uh {disfmarker}
Marketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}
User Interface: Yeah , we will not use this . We will not use this .
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
User Interface: But instead of this I will devise {disfmarker} That's our concept .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Ah , back today . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: And it's got just few buttons , quite low looking , and all this stuff we already we already discussed .
Project Manager: Mm-hmm . 'Kay .
User Interface: And uh what will people say ? They'll say it's perfect . Or what will say ? Uh they will say it's splendid . And uh e everyone will say I'll buy it .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Mm-hmm .
Marketing: {gap} Do you think it can come in several colours ?
User Interface: And everyone's gonna be satisfied .
Marketing: Or did the {disfmarker}
User Interface: {vocalsound} I would make a backlight of the L_C_D_ screen with different colours .
Marketing: Um but not the case .
User Interface: Not the case .
Marketing: Uh the case would only be in that uh aluminium uh titanium stuff ,
User Interface: Yeah .
Marketing: like {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Mm .
Project Manager: Because apparently from your survey people like colours , no ?
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
Marketing: Yeah , well they like uh something which is uh {disfmarker}
User Interface: Okay , so let's remember there's a Nokia phone which changeable panels .
Marketing: Mm yeah , okay ,
User Interface: Do you like it ?
Marketing: so that would be the option . I don't know I don't have a Nokia phone ,
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} But it's uh {disfmarker}
Marketing: but I don't use that but again , uh I might {disfmarker}
User Interface: That's why you don't have it . That's why ,
Marketing: Yeah ,
User Interface: 'cause it's nasty . {vocalsound}
Marketing: bu but {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} But it would be expensive , no ? If you use colour L_C_D_ .
User Interface: No .
Industrial Designer: Uh instead of that maybe we can change the colour of the assembler .
Marketing: Mm-hmm .
Industrial Designer: Maybe we can just {disfmarker} if users want more colours they can pay more money to get this uh the shapes and they can have different assembly .
User Interface: Um , I am here .
Project Manager: Okay .
Industrial Designer: So users have different {disfmarker} I mean they have their own interests , colour interests and so {disfmarker}
Project Manager: So ?
User Interface: Mm-hmm .
Industrial Designer: So we can just {disfmarker} if they want they can just pay another two Euro .
Project Manager: Uh-huh , okay , so
User Interface: 'Kay .
Project Manager: you you propose something with option i that increase the price if we {disfmarker} if you want o more colours {vocalsound} on L_C_D_ ,
Industrial Designer: Yeah . Yeah yeah yes . If they want like uh {disfmarker} so that we can {disfmarker} yeah .
Marketing: Kind of upgradable uh {vocalsound} remote control .
Project Manager: yeah .
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
Project Manager: Okay .
Marketing: Wow , wow .
Industrial Designer: Just they'll get few more things and few more colours .
User Interface: Okay , what uh {disfmarker} there's one more decisi uh one more solution in fact , um {vocalsound} 'cause there are some some paints that can change colour according to where they are , like they can reflect different colours depending on what is around , like what colour is around , and depending on the temperature ,
Industrial Designer: Lights , yeah .
Marketing: Mm .
Project Manager: And thermodynamic also . Mm-hmm .
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
Marketing: Like a chameleon .
Project Manager: Mm-hmm .
User Interface: yeah .
Industrial Designer: Yeah yeah .
User Interface: We can make it in fact .
Project Manager: Yeah but that's maybe mo too much expensive , yeah .
User Interface: If if if the {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Mm .
User Interface: okay .
Marketing: Mm-hmm .
Project Manager: But uh it can be in uh maybe in an {disfmarker} a gradable version ,
User Interface: Mm-hmm , mm-hmm ,
Project Manager: but {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
User Interface: so {disfmarker}
Marketing: Because uh I think there are two kinds of people . Those for which the remote control is uh is to be uh something useful uh I'm going to talk about this later but {disfmarker} and those for which is something that that that uh is uh specific to them so it it's like a signature . My remote control is pink . Nobody else than me has a pink remote control .
Project Manager: Mm-hmm .
User Interface: Uh-huh .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound} And that makes me special .
Project Manager: Okay
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: and you think that we don't have to make to make them pay more because of {vocalsound} uh o or this is {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound} I think I think they would be ready p ready to pay more for that .
Project Manager: Okay , so
Marketing: Those who wanted to have it pink .
Project Manager: so {vocalsound} i it's not uh a s base service
Industrial Designer: Uh {disfmarker}
Marketing: No mm no .
Project Manager: it's a {disfmarker}
User Interface: So ,
Industrial Designer: Mm .
User Interface: {gap} be an option ,
Project Manager: Mm .
User Interface: yeah .
Marketing: It might be optional , yeah .
Project Manager: Okay .
Industrial Designer: But those people will be really few , no ? So like we can {gap} those {disfmarker}
Marketing: The the young people the young people want to be different from their friends .
Industrial Designer: Ah .
Marketing: Although similar but have something just slightly better . Pink {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Mm-hmm .
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
Project Manager: So m so
Industrial Designer: Mm . {vocalsound}
Project Manager: maybe that's {disfmarker} {vocalsound} if that it's a selling point maybe it has to be the base .
User Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah , yeah ,
Marketing: Mm . Yeah .
User Interface: yeah . But you know if you want to be different you just take your remote control with you all the time .
Project Manager: {vocalsound} And you'll be different .
User Interface: {vocalsound} And it makes you different ,
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Yeah , yeah .
User Interface: you know ?
Marketing: You always have your remote .
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Uh in the train uh , hello uh no . {vocalsound} Want to change my neighbour .
User Interface: Anyone has their remote controls here ?
Marketing: Oh , you don't ? {vocalsound} Yeah . You don't have your remo {vocalsound}
User Interface: No ? {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Wh you you know like for instance take the iPod . It's a kind of remote control . {vocalsound} Uh it's white
User Interface: Mm-hmm .
Marketing: and it's so white that you see it from any anywhere .
Project Manager: Mm .
Marketing: It has this distinctive look and feel and look {gap} which people seems to like {vocalsound}
User Interface: Okay .
Marketing: just because it's {vocalsound} a colour that we don't usually see in a remote control . White .
Project Manager: Mm-hmm .
User Interface: Uh-huh , uh-huh . Could we integrate something into our remote control , something like light ?
Marketing: Seems important .
Industrial Designer: Hmm .
User Interface: That they can use it in darkness , like . Hand light ,
Marketing: Mm {gap} glow in the dark ,
Industrial Designer: {gap}
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
User Interface: yeah .
Industrial Designer: Yeah
Marketing: so {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: maybe like the infrared like we can put some radium chips or something
Marketing: {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound} Mm-hmm .
Industrial Designer: so that like {disfmarker} at least um {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Iradium ? {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: yeah .
User Interface: {vocalsound} Okay . Okay .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} {gap} {vocalsound} Yeah ,
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Ah sorry . Mm .
Industrial Designer: that {disfmarker}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Okay . So mm {disfmarker}
User Interface: Okay . S well ,
Marketing: Okay .
User Interface: let's go on maybe with the presentation .
Marketing: Yeah . Uh-huh , yeah sure . {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Mm-hmm . {vocalsound}
User Interface: And um the remote control's going to be smart
Industrial Designer: Oh .
User Interface: but how smart should it be to not to complicate things too much ?
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
User Interface: And uh
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: I dunno
Marketing: {vocalsound}
User Interface: that's a question to you and to mm to {disfmarker}
Marketing: Well so I heard that uh it seems that speech recognition is something that can be done uh so that's the smartness of the thing .
User Interface: Mm-hmm .
Marketing: Currently we don't have guns with speech recognition or uh beer cans with speech recognition
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: but we may have remote controls with speech recognition .
User Interface: Okay , okay .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: I dunno . {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Mm , that's a nice world . {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound} So just just just just think about it um .
Marketing: {vocalsound}
User Interface: {gap} Thank you .
Marketing: Don't touch the remote .
Project Manager: Okay .
Marketing: But {disfmarker} yeah . Are are you saying here that uh the remote controls should be aware of who is using it ? So for instance the young guy would not be able to use it because his father doesn't want .
User Interface: Uh yeah I just want to say it should be real smart .
Marketing: Like with some {disfmarker} Maybe fingerprint recognition or {disfmarker}
User Interface: {vocalsound} Voice recognition is quite tough . I say don't use it , and the control just looks .
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
Marketing: Mm .
User Interface: 'Cause I ordered jus To l to l lock it .
Marketing: Um {disfmarker} Mm .
Industrial Designer: Uh that {disfmarker} mm that could be feasible I guess , like {disfmarker} So since we have {disfmarker} we want to do some speaker dependent speech recognition uh so we can use {disfmarker}
Marketing: Okay . So it could be smart in that way .
Industrial Designer: yeah . Yeah , yeah . {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Mm . Okay .
Marketing: But for instance th I I'm thinking about the other uh uh particularity that the the remote control could have . S since it it knows who is using it , it might also record the kind of uh channels you are u more often using and uh levels of volumes that you're more often uh {disfmarker} things like that
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
Project Manager: Mm .
User Interface: Yeah , sure .
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
Marketing: and provide you ways of using them , I dunno , somehow ,
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
Marketing: I dunno , that might be expensive
Project Manager: Mm-hmm .
Marketing: but
Industrial Designer: Uh it's {disfmarker}
Marketing: that might also be a good sales pitch again .
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Hmm .
Marketing: {vocalsound} The remote that knows you . {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
User Interface: Mm-hmm . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Okay .
User Interface: Okay , thanks .
Project Manager: {vocalsound} So it's {disfmarker}
Marketing: My turn ?
Project Manager: yeah , Marketing Expert .
Marketing: {gap} Okay , it's alright .
Project Manager: Participant two ?
Industrial Designer: Four .
Project Manager: Four ,
Marketing: Four , I think .
Project Manager: sorry .
Marketing: Trend , yeah . No uh yes . Okay , so I'm going to talk about trends and um I hope this can help us to to understand l how we should design our remote control . So , next slide please . So first maybe just a small recap on {vocalsound} how how do we watch trends so it's not so uh simple you might think that it's easy but uh it's not so simple . Anyway these days uh the best uh source of information is the web as you know , so have to to go often on the web and look at uh what the others are doing , and ask real people who are using real remote controls every day uh or any other tool that is similar to a remote control which basically is a small device that people {gap} have with them , always , like a phone . We can we can use the phone as a as a good uh uh {vocalsound} example of where to in be inspired . Of course those tha d who are watching the trends are also {disfmarker} have also to be inspired because in fact they're not only watching the trends , they're inventing it , they're creating the trend . I hope I'm going to try to help you on that . This is more risky because you're not following the trend ,
Project Manager: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}
Marketing: you try to invent it , which means either you succeed and you make a lot of money or you don't and you're out of business . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: So anyway uh next slide please . {vocalsound} Uh to be to be quick {vocalsound} there's a lot of words here but uh basically there are {disfmarker} uh in in the market of of remote controls there are three aspects that we should very {disfmarker} pay much attention to . The first one , which seems to be the most important one , is that it has to be fancy , it has to have a fancy look and feel . And uh interestingly this is the very most important thing . It has to be fancy . Strangely enough it's more important to be fancy than to be wi and now that's the second thing it has to be , it has to be technologically i innovative ,
Industrial Designer: {gap}
Marketing: it has to be new with some of uh new uh technology inside and uh and this is also uh more important than the last thing which we w may think that would have been the most important , which is that it should be easy to use and it should be easy to use as a remote control . So as you see uh {vocalsound} it first have to be very nice , s something that people are proud of uh uh that i uh they can be id identified with uh and and then uh something that um contains very novel stuff that they can talk about with their friends , huh , mine has this and not yours . And finally of course it has to be useful as a remote control but it seems that it's not so important that it's useful as a remote control . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Next slide please .
Project Manager: Mm .
Marketing: Uh and now in a more uh general uh uh broad way of seeing th uh the thing . If we look back and not uh look at only remote controls I think it's important to see that the trends are quite the same in many areas so {disfmarker} currently the the trends that we see in l in l big cities like Paris and Milan , well , it seems that this year things should have uh a fruit and vegetable uh way of {vocalsound} of look or feel
Project Manager: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {gap} {vocalsound}
Marketing: or so . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: And I think of course uh {vocalsound} i it applies to everything . That's the thing with trends . {vocalsound} It it can travel f from clothe to furniture {vocalsound} same idea .
Project Manager: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound}
Marketing: Fruit and vegetable . Think fruit and vegetable . {vocalsound} And uh if we co we compare to last year , now it has to be spongy ,
Industrial Designer: Mm .
User Interface: What is spongy ?
Marketing: yeah . Well
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Yeah
Marketing: this {vocalsound} so so I think uh uh i
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} kind of um maybe {disfmarker} {gap}
Marketing: When we were talking about rubber ,
Industrial Designer: Yeah it {disfmarker}
Marketing: I think uh the rubber aspect might be important because it's what is probably more feasible in terms of sponginess .
Project Manager: Mm-hmm .
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
Project Manager: S So maybe titanium it's not a good idea .
Industrial Designer: Yeah . {gap} We need to think about {disfmarker} mm mm .
Marketing: Seems not , seems not .
Project Manager: Mm-hmm .
Marketing: Yeah .
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Um {vocalsound} sorry Mark .
Marketing: So {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Project Manager: It seems to be {disfmarker}
Marketing: Think more of uh something in the colours of uh like fruit and vegetables and spongy ,
Industrial Designer: Fruit . Even shape ?
Marketing: as a {disfmarker} even in the shape it has to be more round and uh more uh uh look natural somehow . I mean {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} More {gap}
Project Manager: Mm-mm .
Industrial Designer: yeah . Yeah .
Marketing: And not those futuristic uh remote control with angles and uh and titanium like .
Project Manager: Mm-hmm .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Mm .
Project Manager: Hmm . {vocalsound} You're old-fashioned .
Marketing: So that's what people seem to {disfmarker} {vocalsound} yeah i I know it's quite far from what you thought
Project Manager: Sorry . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: but that's that's fashion and {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
